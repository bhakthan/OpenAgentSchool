# Tutorial Mode for Azure AI Agent Visualization

## Core Purpose & Success

- **Mission Statement**: Create an interactive tutorial mode for first-time users of the Azure AI Agent Visualization tool that guides them through key features and functionality.
- **Success Indicators**: Increased user engagement, reduced confusion for new users, and higher completion rates of first-time interactions with complex features.
- **Experience Qualities**: Intuitive, educational, and non-intrusive.

## Project Classification & Approach

- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (interactive tutorial with state management)
- **Primary User Activity**: Acting (following guided steps through the application)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection

- **Core Problem Analysis**: First-time users of the Azure AI Agent visualization tool may be overwhelmed by the complexity and abundance of features, leading to confusion and reduced engagement.
- **User Context**: Users will engage with tutorials during their initial exploration of the platform, when they need help understanding specific sections, or when they want to learn about newly added features.
- **Critical Path**: User enters site → Sees tutorial prompt → Follows step-by-step guidance → Completes tutorial → Explores application independently with newfound knowledge.
- **Key Moments**: 
  1. The initial welcome tutorial that orients users to the application
  2. Section-specific tutorials that explain specialized features (patterns, concepts, code playbook)
  3. Tutorial completion with clear call-to-action for next steps

## Essential Features

1. **Tutorial Step System**
   - Functionality: Guide users through app features with sequenced, highlighted steps
   - Purpose: Reduce learning curve and orient users to the application's capabilities
   - Success Criteria: Users can complete tutorials without getting stuck or confused

2. **Contextual Help Overlays**
   - Functionality: Display information bubbles that explain specific UI elements
   - Purpose: Provide just-in-time education about components as users encounter them
   - Success Criteria: Tooltips correctly target relevant UI elements with accurate descriptions

3. **Tutorial State Management**
   - Functionality: Track tutorial completion status and progress across sessions
   - Purpose: Allow users to resume tutorials and prevent repeated tutorials for returning users
   - Success Criteria: Tutorial state correctly persists across browser sessions using localStorage

4. **Section-specific Tutorials**
   - Functionality: Provide dedicated tutorials for different application areas (Concepts, Patterns, Code Playbook)
   - Purpose: Target education to specific user needs and contexts
   - Success Criteria: Each major section has its own dedicated, contextually relevant tutorial flow

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity

- **Emotional Response**: The tutorial should evoke a sense of clarity and confidence, reducing anxiety about using complex features.
- **Design Personality**: Approachable and professional, aligning with the main application's clean, modern aesthetic.
- **Visual Metaphors**: Light bulb for tutorials, guiding spotlight for highlighted elements.
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Balanced interface with clear, concise instructions while maintaining visual richness for highlighting important elements.

### Color Strategy

- **Color Scheme Type**: Using the existing application's color scheme with subtle highlights for tutorial elements.
- **Primary Color**: The application's primary color (#10a37f - OpenAI green) for tutorial buttons and highlights.
- **Secondary Colors**: Neutral background overlays that don't distract from the highlighted components.
- **Accent Color**: Subtle pulse animations in the primary color to draw attention to interactive elements.
- **Color Psychology**: Using the familiar primary green to maintain brand consistency while creating a sense of guidance.
- **Color Accessibility**: Maintaining WCAG AA compliance with sufficient contrast for all tutorial elements.
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Tutorial overlay text (foreground: #2d333a) on light background (background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95))
  - Button text (foreground: white) on primary action color (background: #10a37f)

### Typography System

- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Continuing the application's existing font pairing of 'Inter' for headings and 'Source Sans Pro' for body text.
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between tutorial titles, instructions, and navigation elements.
- **Font Personality**: Professional but friendly, matching the educational nature of the application.
- **Readability Focus**: Short, concise tutorial messages with clear calls to action.
- **Typography Consistency**: Maintaining consistent font sizes and weights with the main application.
- **Which fonts**: Using existing Inter and Source Sans Pro from Google Fonts.
- **Legibility Check**: All tutorial text will be at least 14px in size with sufficient line spacing for optimal readability.

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout

- **Attention Direction**: Tutorial overlays use spotlights and borders to guide attention to the relevant UI elements.
- **White Space Philosophy**: Adequate spacing around tutorial messages to avoid visual clutter.
- **Grid System**: Tutorial components align with the application's existing grid for visual consistency.
- **Responsive Approach**: Tutorial overlays adjust position and size based on screen dimensions, ensuring visibility on all devices.
- **Content Density**: Concise instructions with progressive disclosure for additional details.

### Animations

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle animations indicate which elements are interactive and guide user attention.
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Primary focus elements (like highlighted UI components) receive more prominent animations.
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Gentle fade transitions for tutorial steps to avoid jarring visual changes.

### UI Elements & Component Selection

- **Component Usage**: Using Cards for tutorial content, with clear progression indicators.
- **Component Customization**: Adding a pulsing highlight effect for target elements.
- **Component States**: Clearly indicating current, completed, and upcoming tutorial steps.
- **Icon Selection**: Using the Lightbulb icon from Phosphor Icons to represent tutorial functionality.
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary buttons for step progression, secondary buttons for optional actions.
- **Spacing System**: Consistent padding using Tailwind's spacing scale throughout tutorial elements.
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Adjusted positioning and sizing of tutorial overlays for smaller screens.

### Visual Consistency Framework

- **Design System Approach**: Using component-based design that integrates with the existing Shadcn UI components.
- **Style Guide Elements**: Consistent use of colors, typography, and spacing across all tutorial elements.
- **Visual Rhythm**: Creating predictable patterns for tutorial navigation and progression.
- **Brand Alignment**: Maintaining the clean, professional aesthetic of the main application.

### Accessibility & Readability

- **Contrast Goal**: All text and UI elements meet WCAG AA standards for color contrast.

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios

- **Potential Obstacles**: 
  - Users accessing deeply nested routes directly (bypassing main tutorials)
  - UI changes affecting tutorial target elements
  - Users on very small screens where positioning overlays is challenging
- **Edge Case Handling**: 
  - Allow tutorials to be started from any section
  - Use robust selectors for UI elements that can handle minor changes
  - Implement fallback positioning for tutorial overlays on small screens
- **Technical Constraints**: 
  - Tutorial performance on low-end devices
  - Browser compatibility for localStorage persistence

## Implementation Considerations

- **Scalability Needs**: The tutorial system should be easily extendable to add new tutorials for future features.
- **Testing Focus**: Test tutorial flows on various screen sizes and browsers to ensure consistent experience.
- **Critical Questions**: 
  - How can we balance comprehensive guidance with avoiding tutorial fatigue?
  - Should tutorials be mandatory for first-time users or entirely optional?

## Reflection

- The strength of this tutorial mode lies in its contextual relevance, guiding users when and where they need help rather than overwhelming them with a single comprehensive onboarding.
- We've assumed users want guided tutorials rather than discovering features through exploration, which should be validated with user testing.
- To make this solution exceptional, we could add intelligent adaptive behavior that adjusts tutorial content based on user interaction patterns and previous experience levels.
