    longDescription: `
      The ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern is a powerful framework that enables AI agents to alternate between 
      reasoning steps and action steps when solving problems. This approach combines the strengths of chain-of-thought 
      reasoning with the ability to interact with external tools and information sources.
      
      In the ReAct pattern, an agent first reasons about the current state of a problem, then decides on an appropriate 
      action to take (such as searching for information, performing a calculation, or using another tool). After 
      receiving feedback from the action, the agent continues reasoning with this new information, creating a cycle 
      of thinking and doing that mimics human problem-solving.
      
      This pattern is particularly effective for complex tasks that require both analytical thinking and retrieval of 
      external information, as it gives agents the ability to break down problems, gather relevant data, and integrate 
      that data into their reasoning process.

    longDescription: `
      CodeAct is a specialized agent architecture developed by Manus AI that enables LLM agents to directly execute Python code 
      instead of relying on structured JSON output formats. This architecture significantly enhances an agent's ability to handle 
      complex computational tasks by leveraging the full power and flexibility of a programming language.
      
      In the CodeAct pattern, the agent thinks through a problem, writes Python code to solve specific aspects of it, executes 
      that code in a controlled environment, observes the results, and then continues the problem-solving process with this new 
      information. This creates a powerful feedback loop between reasoning and computation.
      
      The key innovation of CodeAct is that it allows for much more sophisticated problem-solving compared to traditional 
      function-calling approaches. While function calling restricts agents to pre-defined API operations, CodeAct enables 
      dynamic creation of custom algorithms, data transformations, visualizations, and analyses tailored to the specific 
      task at hand.

    id: 'self-reflection',
    name: 'Self-Reflection',
    longDescription: `
      Self-Reflection (also known as Reflexion) is an architectural pattern where an AI agent critically evaluates its own outputs, 
      identifies potential errors or improvements, and iteratively refines its responses. This meta-cognitive approach mimics the 
      human ability to review and improve one's own work through critical thinking.
      
      In this pattern, after generating an initial response, the agent shifts into an evaluative mode where it analyzes the quality, 
      accuracy, completeness, and other aspects of its response. Based on this self-critique, the agent then generates an improved 
      version, potentially repeating this cycle multiple times until satisfactory quality is achieved.
      
      Self-Reflection can leverage both memory of past experiences and external tools for verification, but its distinguishing 
      feature is the explicit step of critical analysis applied to the agent's own output rather than relying solely on external 
      feedback or evaluation.

    name: 'Agentic RAG',
    longDescription: `
      Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) enhances traditional RAG systems by incorporating agent-like behaviors 
      into the retrieval and generation process. While standard RAG simply retrieves relevant documents and feeds them 
      directly to a language model, Agentic RAG adds intelligent intermediary steps including query planning, active 
      retrieval strategies, evaluation of information quality, and synthesis across multiple sources.
      
      This pattern gives the system agency in how it interacts with knowledge sources - it can formulate multiple search 
      queries, evaluate the relevance of retrieved information, decide when more information is needed, and intelligently 
      synthesize across disparate sources to create coherent, well-reasoned responses.
      
      Agentic RAG systems typically leverage vector databases for efficient similarity search, but add layers of 
      intelligence around query formulation, result filtering, and information synthesis that make them more powerful 
      than simple vector lookups.

      The Modern Tool Use pattern represents an evolved approach to integrating AI agents with external tools and APIs, 
      particularly leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized communication. This pattern focuses on 
      enabling agents to access diverse specialized tools with minimal direct code execution, enhancing capabilities 
      while maintaining security and simplicity.
      
      Unlike older approaches that required custom code for each tool integration, Modern Tool Use emphasizes standardized 
      interfaces through protocols like MCP that create consistent ways for agents to discover, request, and utilize tool 
      capabilities. This allows agents to leverage specialized services like Kagi Search for information retrieval, cloud 
      services like AWS for computation and storage, and other tools without needing to understand their implementation details.
      
      The pattern typically involves an agent determining what tools are needed, constructing appropriate requests through a 
      protocol layer, and then integrating the results into a unified response. This creates a more modular and extensible 
      system where new tools can be added without changing the core agent logic.

      MCP addresses key challenges in enterprise AI deployments such as context management, security, and regulatory compliance. The protocol 
      separates context handling from model execution, enabling specialized optimization of each component while maintaining interoperability.
      
      The key components of MCP include the context system (which receives queries and determines what information is needed), the context router 
      (which directs requests to appropriate knowledge sources), security filters (which enforce access controls), and the context builder

      The Agent to Agent (A2A) pattern establishes a framework for communication and collaboration between multiple AI agents, each with

      A2A communication typically flows through a message bus or coordinator that manages the exchange of structured messages between agents.

      Prompt chaining is a technique that breaks down complex tasks into a sequence of simpler steps, where each step is handled by a separate LLM call. 
      The output from one LLM call becomes the input for the next, creating a chain of processing that progressively works toward solving the original problem.
      
      This approach mimics human problem-solving by decomposing complex tasks into manageable pieces. Each LLM call can be specialized for its specific subtask, 
      with prompts engineered to elicit the exact type of processing needed at that stage.

      In this pattern, the same query might be processed by multiple different prompts, different model parameters (temperature, top_p), or even different LLM models entirely. 
      The results are then aggregated using methods ranging from simple concatenation to sophisticated synthesis (potentially using another LLM call).

    longDescription: `
      The Routing pattern involves using an LLM to classify or categorize an input and then direct it to the most appropriate
      specialized handler. This approach allows for separation of concerns, with the router focusing on classification and
      specialized components handling domain-specific processing.
      
      The router typically acts as a first-pass analysis layer, determining the nature, intent, or domain of the input. Based on
      this classification, the input is directed to one of several possible paths, each optimized for handling a particular type
      of request or content.
      
      This pattern is particularly valuable in systems that need to handle diverse inputs requiring different types of expertise
      or processing approaches. It allows for modularity and specialization while maintaining a single entry point.

    longDescription: `
      The Autonomous Workflow pattern creates a self-directed agent that interacts with its environment in a continuous
      loop of perception, reasoning, and action. The LLM receives feedback from the environment after each action and uses
      this updated context to determine its next steps.
      
      This pattern is distinguished by its dynamic nature - rather than following a predetermined sequence, the agent
      adapts its behavior based on environmental feedback. The LLM maintains state across iterations, building up context
      and history that inform future decisions.
      
      The environment can include various tools and capabilities that the agent can leverage, such as search engines,
      calculators, databases, or APIs. The agent chooses which tools to use based on its assessment of the current situation
      and task requirements.

      The Reflexion pattern implements a self-improvement cycle where an LLM critically evaluates its own outputs and

      reflecting on its quality, identifying issues, and producing an improved version.
      
      Unlike simpler feedback loops, Reflexion emphasizes the agent's ability to generate its own feedback rather than
      relying on external evaluation. The reflection process may consider multiple aspects including accuracy,
      completeness, reasoning quality, ethical considerations, and alignment with goals.
      
      The pattern can involve multiple iterations, with each cycle potentially focusing on different aspects of
      improvement. This creates a progressive refinement process that can yield significantly better results than
      single-pass generation.

      Computer Using Agents (CUA) represent a specialized agent pattern that enables AI systems to interact with computer 
      interfaces just as humans do. Unlike traditional agents that might access data or functionality through APIs, CUAs

      This pattern creates a bridge between AI capabilities and existing software applications without requiring special 
      integration or API access. The CUA observes the screen, understands the interface context (identifying buttons,

      The Deep Researcher pattern extends basic RAG capabilities into an advanced research assistant that can conduct
