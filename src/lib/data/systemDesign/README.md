## Adding New System Design Patterns

To add a new system design pattern:

1. **Create a new file** for your pattern (e.g., `myNewPattern.ts`)
2. **Import types** from `./types`
3. **Export your pattern** following the `SystemDesignPattern` interface
4. **Add to registry** in `index.ts`:
   - Import your pattern
   - Add it to the `systemDesignPatterns` object
   - Export the pattern

### Example Pattern File Structure

```typescript
import { SystemDesignPattern } from './types';

export const myNewPatternSystemDesign: SystemDesignPattern = {
  id: 'my-new-pattern',
  name: 'My New Pattern System Design',
  overview: 'Overview of what this pattern does...',
  problemStatement: 'What problem does this solve...',
  solution: 'How does this pattern solve the problem...',
  steps: [
    {
      id: 'step-1',
      title: 'Step Title',
      category: 'prompt', // or 'context', 'knowledge', 'evaluation', 'architecture', 'tools', 'instruction'
      description: 'Brief description',
      details: 'Detailed implementation guide',
      considerations: ['Key consideration 1', 'Key consideration 2'],
      bestPractices: ['Best practice 1', 'Best practice 2'],
      examples: ['Code example 1', 'Code example 2']
    }
    // ... more steps
  ],
  architecture: {
    components: [
      {
        name: 'Component Name',
        type: 'processing', // or 'input', 'storage', 'output', 'control'
        description: 'What this component does'
      }
      // ... more components
    ],
    flows: [
      {
        from: 'Component A',
        to: 'Component B',
        description: 'How data flows between components'
      }
      // ... more flows
    ]
  }
};
```

### Step Categories

Each step should be categorized using one of these types:

- **`prompt`**: Prompt engineering and instruction design
- **`context`**: Context management and memory systems
- **`knowledge`**: Knowledge retrieval and management
- **`evaluation`**: Performance measurement and testing
- **`architecture`**: System architecture and design
- **`tools`**: Tool integration and external systems
- **`instruction`**: Workflow control and instruction following

### Component Types

Architecture components should use these types:

- **`input`**: User interfaces and input handlers
- **`processing`**: Core processing and reasoning components
- **`storage`**: Data storage and memory systems
- **`output`**: Response generation and presentation
- **`control`**: Orchestration and workflow management

## Available Patterns

### Core Agent Patterns

#### Python ReAct Agent (`react-agent`)

Comprehensive system design for building Python-based ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) agents with structured reasoning frameworks, tool integration, and iterative improvement capabilities.

#### Agentic RAG (`agentic-rag`)

Intelligent retrieval-augmented generation system with planning agents, adaptive retrieval strategies, and sophisticated reasoning over knowledge bases.

#### CodeAct Agent (`code-act`, `codeact-agent`)

Advanced system design for agents that can understand, generate, execute, and iterate on code through secure execution environments, testing frameworks, and intelligent code generation.

#### Parallelization Agent (`parallelization`)

#### Prompt Chaining Agent (`prompt-chaining`)

Comprehensive system for creating and executing sophisticated chains of prompts to solve complex multi-step problems through sequential reasoning and adaptive chain modification.

### Advanced Agent Patterns

#### Agent Evaluation (`agent-evaluation`)

Systematic framework for evaluating agent performance, including metrics design, test case generation, performance monitoring, and continuous improvement strategies.

#### Autonomous Workflow (`autonomous-workflow`)

Self-managing workflow systems that can adapt, optimize, and execute complex multi-step processes with minimal human intervention and intelligent error recovery.

#### Computer Use Agent (`computer-use`)

Comprehensive system for agents that can interact with computer interfaces, including screen understanding, action planning, and safe automated interactions.

#### Deep Researcher (`deep-researcher`)

Advanced research automation system with intelligent source discovery, content analysis, synthesis capabilities, and comprehensive knowledge extraction.

#### Evaluator-Optimizer (`evaluator-optimizer`)

Dual-purpose system combining performance evaluation with continuous optimization, featuring adaptive improvement strategies and intelligent parameter tuning.

#### Modern Tool Use (`modern-tool-use`)

Next-generation tool integration framework with dynamic tool discovery, intelligent selection, and sophisticated tool composition for complex tasks.

#### Self-Reflection Agent (`self-reflection`)

Metacognitive agent system with introspective capabilities, performance self-assessment, and adaptive learning from experience.

#### Voice Agent (`voice-agent`)

Comprehensive voice-enabled agent system with speech processing, natural conversation management, and multimodal interaction capabilities.

### Multi-Agent Patterns

#### Agent-to-Agent Communication (`agent-to-agent`)

Sophisticated inter-agent communication system with protocol design, message routing, coordination strategies, and distributed decision-making capabilities.

#### AutoGen Multi-Agent (`autogen-multi-agent`)

Microsoft AutoGen-inspired multi-agent framework with role-based collaboration, conversation management, and intelligent agent coordination.

#### Orchestrator-Worker (`orchestrator-worker`)

Hierarchical multi-agent system with centralized orchestration, distributed task execution, and intelligent workload distribution.

#### Routing Agent (`routing`)

Intelligent request routing system that dynamically selects and coordinates appropriate agents based on task requirements and agent capabilities.

#### Model Context Protocol (`model-context-protocol`)

Standardized protocol system for model interaction, context sharing, and interoperability between different AI systems and frameworks.

## Usage

The system design patterns are automatically available in the Code Playbook's "System Design" tab when a matching pattern ID exists for an agent pattern.

```typescript
import { getSystemDesignPattern } from '@/lib/data/systemDesign';

// Get a specific pattern
const pattern = getSystemDesignPattern('react-agent');

// Check if pattern exists
import { hasSystemDesignPattern } from '@/lib/data/systemDesign';
const exists = hasSystemDesignPattern('my-pattern-id');

// Get all available patterns
import { getAvailableSystemDesignPatterns } from '@/lib/data/systemDesign';
const allPatterns = getAvailableSystemDesignPatterns();
```

## Benefits of This Structure

- **Modularity**: Each pattern is self-contained and easy to maintain
- **Scalability**: Adding new patterns doesn't affect existing ones
- **Type Safety**: Consistent TypeScript interfaces across all patterns
- **Reusability**: Patterns can be easily imported and reused
- **Organization**: Clear separation of concerns and logical grouping
- **Maintainability**: Easier to review, update, and debug individual patterns
