    description: 'Master the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) agent pattern that revolutionizes AI problem-solving by combining explicit reasoning traces with targeted action execution. This pattern enables agents to think through problems step-by-step while taking concrete actions based on their reasoning. Key components include: Reasoning Phase (where agents verbalize their thought process, analyze the problem, consider available information, and plan their approach), Acting Phase (where agents execute specific actions using available tools, APIs, or functions), Observation Phase (where agents process the results of their actions and update their understanding), and Iteration Cycle (continuing the reason-act-observe loop until the goal is achieved). The pattern is particularly effective for complex problem-solving scenarios that require both analytical thinking and practical execution. Implementation involves prompt engineering techniques that encourage explicit reasoning, tool integration for action execution, state management for tracking progress, and error handling for robust operation. Azure integration examples include using Azure OpenAI Service for reasoning capabilities, Azure Functions for action execution, Azure Application Insights for observability, and Azure Cognitive Services for enhanced perception. Use cases span research tasks, data analysis, troubleshooting, planning and execution scenarios, and any domain requiring methodical problem-solving approaches. Best practices include designing clear reasoning prompts, implementing reliable tools, maintaining context across iterations, handling edge cases gracefully, and providing clear success criteria.',

Unlike traditional structured JSON output formats, CodeAct agents express their actions directly through executable Python code, providing unprecedented flexibility and capability for computational tasks. Core components include: Code Generation (where agents write Python scripts to solve problems, manipulate data, interact with APIs, and perform calculations), Code Execution (secure sandbox environments for running generated code with proper isolation and safety measures), Result Interpretation (agents analyze execution outputs, handle errors, and adapt their approach), Iterative Refinement (continuous improvement through code modification and optimization), and State Management (maintaining context and variables across code execution cycles). The pattern excels at mathematical computations, data analysis, file manipulation, web scraping, API interactions, visualization generation, and complex algorithmic tasks. Security considerations include sandboxed execution environments, input validation, resource limitations, network restrictions, and comprehensive logging. Azure implementation leverages Azure Functions for secure code execution, Azure Container Instances for isolated environments, Azure Storage for file operations, Azure Key Vault for secure API access, and Azure Monitor for execution tracking. Best practices encompass secure execution environments, comprehensive error handling, resource management, code quality validation, and extensive testing protocols.',
