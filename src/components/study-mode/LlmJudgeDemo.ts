// Demo: Testing LLM Judge Integration
// This file demonstrates how the LLM-as-a-judge functionality works

/*
## üéØ LLM Judge Integration Summary

I've successfully integrated LLM-as-a-judge functionality into both Study Mode components:

### üß† Socratic Questioning Mode
- **When**: Final "Complete Discovery" button is clicked
- **What**: LLM evaluates the entire learning journey across all questions
- **Assessment**: 
  - Depth of thinking and reasoning
  - Connection to core concepts
  - Learning progression evidence
  - Critical thinking development
- **Response**: Score (0-100), detailed feedback, suggestions, insights, strengths, and improvements

### üêõ Debug Challenge Mode  
- **When**: Each "Continue to Next Phase" button is clicked
- **What**: LLM evaluates each debugging phase (Analysis, Diagnosis, Solution)
- **Assessment**:
  - **Analysis Phase**: Systematic observation, error patterns, system behavior
  - **Diagnosis Phase**: Root cause accuracy, logical reasoning, issue consideration
  - **Solution Phase**: Practical approach, addresses causes, implementation feasibility
- **Response**: Phase-specific score, feedback, suggestions, and methodology assessment

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Core Components:
1. **llmJudge.ts**: LLM integration service with specialized prompts
2. **SocraticQuestionMode.tsx**: Enhanced with completion assessment
3. **DebugChallengeMode.tsx**: Enhanced with phase-by-phase evaluation

### Key Features:
- ‚úÖ Async LLM calls with loading states
- ‚úÖ Detailed educational feedback
- ‚úÖ Error handling with graceful fallbacks
- ‚úÖ Rich UI display of assessments
- ‚úÖ Integration with existing scoring systems

## üöÄ User Experience

### Socratic Mode:
1. User completes all questions in the sequence
2. Clicks "Complete Discovery" ‚Üí Shows "Getting AI Assessment..." 
3. LLM analyzes entire learning journey
4. Displays comprehensive assessment with score, feedback, and insights

### Debug Mode:
1. User completes each phase (Analysis, Diagnosis, Solution)
2. Clicks "Continue to Next Phase" ‚Üí Shows "Getting AI Assessment..."
3. LLM evaluates current phase approach
4. Shows 3-second assessment overlay with score and suggestions
5. Automatically progresses to next phase

## üìã Environment Setup Required

To use this functionality, you need to configure at least one LLM provider in your environment:

```json
{
  "VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-your-openai-api-key-here",
  // OR any other supported provider (Azure, Gemini, HuggingFace, OpenRouter, Claude)
}
```

## üéÆ How to Test

1. Navigate to Study Mode ‚Üí Socratic Questioning
2. Complete a question sequence and click "Complete Discovery"
3. Watch for AI assessment with detailed feedback

1. Navigate to Study Mode ‚Üí Debug Challenge Mode  
2. Complete any phase and click "Continue to Next Phase"
3. See immediate AI evaluation of your debugging approach

The system will provide rich, educational feedback to help learners improve their thinking and problem-solving skills!
