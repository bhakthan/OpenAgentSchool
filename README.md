**Where AI Agent Concepts Come to Life**

*Built for AI by AI with lots of human intervention in the loop*

An interactive educational platform for understanding AI agents, Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication, Model Context Protocol (MCP), and Agent Communication Protocol (ACP). This application provides comprehensive visualizations, micro-learning modules, hands-on demonstrations of modern AI agent architectures, revolutionary **Study Mode** for discovery-based learning through Socratic questioning, interactive scenarios, and debug challenges, plus **Critical Thinking Challenges** with LLM-powered assessment and feedback.

‚ú® **Now featuring 27 comprehensive agent patterns including 15 revolutionary Educational Agent Patterns** - from foundational concepts to advanced GPT-5 era educational methodologies with complete Study Mode integration.

> Architecture split note: If you deploy backends separately (or in another repo), see docs/CONTRACTS_AND_CONFIG.md for the minimal frontend ‚Üî backend contracts and environment settings. The SPA keeps working locally with defaults; set VITE_* variables later to point at remote services.

## üÜï Latest Updates (September 6, 2025)

### üå≥ Knowledge Tree Visualization Overhaul

Brand identity and export fidelity upgrades to the global learning taxonomy tree:

* Root node renamed to **openagentschool.org** with embedded full‚Äëcolor ladder logo (no background ring; adaptive to light/dark)
* Precise text centering above the logo (anchor middle) with refined font sizing
* Corrected taxonomy: **Fine-Tuning Methods (SFT, DPO, RFT)** moved from Tier 0 to **Tier 3 ‚Äì Advanced Integration**
* Enhanced spacing heuristics (depth‚Äëbased edge multipliers + refined first‚Äëlevel distance) for better readability and reduced horizontal scroll
* Light & dark theme contrast tuning for links, labels, and node strokes
* Centered layout container with reduced left shift for visual balance
* Novel item ring styling preserved; root node stroke removed for clean brand focus

### üñ®Ô∏è High-Fidelity Export & Print Suite

Professional asset generation directly from the visualization interface:

* One‚Äëclick exports: **SVG**, **PNG 2√ó / 3√ó**, and **PDF (auto portrait/landscape)**
* Automatic **fit-to-content** bounding box cropping (optional toggle)
* **Transparent background** toggle for slide decks & dark slide themes
* Clean vector serialization with embedded font stack for portability
* Smart padding + deterministic viewBox scaling (no clipped nodes)
* Print button (standard & fullscreen) for native browser print workflows

### üß¨ Fine-Tuning Concept Module Expansion

New multi-tab deep dive covering the full fine-tuning lifecycle:

* Tabs: Overview, **Data**, **SFT**, **DPO**, **RFT**, **Evaluation**, **Ops**, **References**
* Dedicated **References** tab with authoritative external links (3 curated sources)
* Clear separation of supervised vs preference vs reinforcement refinement workflows
* Evaluation & Ops tabs outline continuous improvement + deployment considerations

### üó∫Ô∏è Data Strategy Visual ‚Äì Dual Mode Redesign

The Data Strategy visualization now has genuinely distinct modes:

* **Technical Mode**: Detailed ingestion ‚Üí curation ‚Üí alignment ‚Üí sampling ‚Üí packaging steps with directional arrows and staged highlight animation
* Overflow containment & responsive scaling inside concept cards (no bleed)
* Improved arrow geometry + consistent timing loop for pedagogical pacing

### üé® Branding & UX Polish

* Full-color ladder logo replaces temporary monochrome ladder lines
* Removed blue circular background behind logo for theme neutrality
* Root label optical alignment & slight size reduction for hierarchy clarity
* Subtle node spacing refinements to prioritize early-tier scan paths

### üìö Reference Enhancements

* Added authoritative fine‚Äëtuning resource links in new References tab
* Consistent external link iconography & accessibility labelling

### üß© Internal Architecture / Code Improvements

* Refactored tree root rendering to isolate logo image layer (no stroke collisions)
* Centralized fit-to-content bounding box logic reused across SVG/PNG/PDF exporters
* Defensive `getBBox()` guards to avoid runtime errors in headless contexts
* Theming helpers (`getNodeFill`, `getLinkColor`, `getTextColor`) simplified & root override applied without side effects

### ‚úÖ Impact

These changes significantly improve:

* Knowledge map shareability (slide-ready exports, transparent backgrounds)
* Pedagogical clarity (accurate tier placement for fine-tuning, dual-mode data strategy)
* Brand consistency (domain root + full-color logo)
* Accessibility & readability (contrast-tuned strokes & labels)
* Maintenance (export pipeline reuse + style centralization)
