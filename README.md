- **State Management**: See components transition between idle, processing, responding, and error states
- **Interactive Controls**: Play/pause animations, step through communications, reset scenarios

### 🤖 Agent Personality Showcase
**Making AI agents relatable and memorable**:
- **Six Unique Personalities**: Each with distinct communication styles and problem-solving approaches
- **Thinking Simulations**: Floating thought bubbles show how different agents approach the same problem
- **Pattern Connections**: See how personality traits map to actual code implementation patterns
- **Interactive Dialogues**: Experience how each agent would handle real-world scenarios

### 💻 Code-to-Visual Pattern Mapper
**Bridge the gap between code and concepts**:
- **Three View Modes**: Switch between Visual Flow, Code View, and Execution Simulation
- **Real-time Mapping**: Watch code execute while seeing the visual representation update
- **Variable Tracking**: Monitor state changes and data flow through the system
- **Pattern Examples**: ReAct, CodeAct, and Self-Reflection patterns with full implementations

### 📊 Pattern Visualizers
- **Live Code-to-Visual Mapping**: See code transform into visual workflows in real-time
- **Interactive Parameter Adjustment**: Modify variables and watch the impact on visualization
- **Performance Comparison Tools**: Compare different approaches side-by-side
- **Best Practice Recommendations**: Get suggestions based on your implementation choices

## 🔧 Customization

### Themes
The application supports light and dark themes with:
- Consistent color schemes across all visualizations
- Accessible contrast ratios
- Smooth theme transitions

### Extending Patterns
Add new agent patterns by:
1. Creating pattern definitions in `src/lib/data/patterns.ts`
2. Adding visualizations in `src/components/patterns/`
3. Including code examples for all knowledge levels
4. Adding interactive demos if applicable

### Custom Visualizations
Create new visualizations by:
1. Extending base visualization components
2. Implementing animation controls (play/pause/reset)
3. Adding micro-learning overlays
4. Including accessibility features
