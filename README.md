## What's Inside

| | Question | Answer |
|---|----------|--------|
| **Why** | Why does this exist? | Most AI agent resources are scattered blog posts or vendor docs. Open Agent School brings concepts, patterns, and production practices into one interactive platform — so you learn the *why* behind each pattern, not just the API call. |
| **What** | What does it cover? | 65+ agent patterns, 200+ quiz questions, interactive D3 visualizations, Socratic study mode, critical thinking challenges, exportable diagrams (SVG/PNG/PDF), and downloadable strategy toolkits — from fundamentals to production ops. |
| **Where** | Where does it run? | **Web** — live at [openagentschool.org](https://openagentschool.org). **PWA** — install on mobile or desktop for offline access. **Local dev** — clone the repo and `npm run dev` on localhost:5000. |
| **When** | When should I use it? | When you're learning AI agents for the first time, evaluating patterns for a production system, preparing for a technical interview, or onboarding a team to agentic architecture — from first concept to org-wide adoption. |
| **Who** | Who is it for? | Developers building AI agents, architects designing multi-agent systems, product managers evaluating agentic capabilities, and teams adopting AI — from individual learners to enterprise adoption programs. |
| **How** | How is it built? | React 18 + TypeScript + Vite frontend with TailwindCSS and Radix UI. Optional Python FastAPI backend for study sessions and AI-powered assessments. Deployed on Azure Static Web Apps with GitHub Actions CI/CD. |
| **Best For** | What's the sweet spot? | Engineers who learn by doing — interactive visualizations, hands-on scenarios, and Socratic questioning beat passive reading. Also ideal for teams using the [Adoption Playbook](https://openagentschool.org) to drive org-wide AI transformation. |
| **Keys?** | Do I need API keys? | **No keys required to learn.** The entire platform works without any API keys. When you're ready for AI-powered features (study assessments, voice narration, cloud speech), bring your own keys — they stay in your browser's localStorage and never leave your device. |

##  Recent Updates (February 26, 2026)

### 🎨 17 Visual Themes — Full Theme System Overhaul

The platform now ships **17 hand-crafted themes** (12 dark + 5 light) with a theme picker dropdown accessible from the sun/moon button in the navigation bar. Switching themes triggers a **View Transitions API** sweep animation for a polished, directional reveal effect.

| Dark Themes | Light Themes |
|---|---|
| Void Black (default) | Warm Parchment (default) |
| Aurora — northern-lights teal/green | Arctic — cool icy blue |
| Rosé — pink-mauve on charcoal | Sakura — cherry blossom pink |
| Cyber — neon teal/cyan | Sandstone — warm beige/earthy |
| Abyss — deep ocean blues | Ivory — clean cream white |
| Velvet — purple luxe | |
| Ember — warm amber/orange | |
| Verdant — nature green | |
| Solar — warm gold/yellow | |
| Mono — pure grayscale | |
| Crimson — blood red | |
| Malachite — emerald green | |

**Technical details:** Each theme maps to the same shadcn/ui CSS variable names (`--background`, `--foreground`, `--card`, `--primary`, `--muted`, `--border`, etc.) so every component works with any theme. The `ThemeProvider` derives an `isDarkMode` boolean from a `DARK_THEMES` set, ensuring Tailwind `dark:` variants remain correct across all 17 themes. Theme preference is persisted to `localStorage` under the `ui-theme` key.

See [THEME.md](./THEME.md) for the full theme reference (swatches, CSS variables, and developer guide).

##  Previous Updates (February 21, 2026)

### 🌍 Full Cloud Speech Provider Coverage (NEW)

All major cloud platforms now supported for voice input and audio narration — **11 cloud speech services** across 5 STT and 6 TTS engines:

| Provider | STT | TTS | Notes |
|----------|-----|-----|-------|
| **OpenAI** | Whisper API | TTS (alloy, coral, etc.) | Direct API key |
| **OpenAI Audio Model** | — | Translate + narrate in 1 call | gpt-4o-mini-audio-preview, Azure OpenAI |
| **Azure** | Cognitive Speech | Neural TTS (400+ voices) | Enterprise, region-based |
| **Deepgram** | Nova-2 | — | Real-time streaming |
| **ElevenLabs** | — | Multilingual v2 | Ultra-realistic voices |
| **Google Cloud** | Speech-to-Text v1 | TTS (WaveNet / Neural2) | Falls back to Gemini key |
| **AWS** | Transcribe (via proxy) | Polly (via proxy) | Requires backend relay for SigV4 |

**Design note:** Google Cloud APIs work directly with an API key. AWS APIs require SigV4 signing and use a configurable proxy/backend endpoint — the Settings UI clearly communicates this requirement.

##  Previous Updates (February 21, 2026)

### 🔑 BYOK Configuration & Local Storage Settings (NEW)

Learners who clone the repo or use the live platform can now **bring their own API keys** — stored entirely in the browser's `localStorage`, never transmitted anywhere.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|--------|
| **LLM Providers** | OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, Hugging Face, OpenRouter, Custom (OpenAI-compatible) — plus local runners (Ollama, LM Studio) and international presets (DeepSeek, Zhipu AI, Alibaba Qwen, Moonshot AI, Volcano Engine, Mistral, Sarvam AI, BharatGen) |
| **Smart Defaults** | Provider-specific placeholders (key format hints like `sk-…`, `AIza…`), default URLs, suggested models |
| **Required Fields** | Azure OpenAI URL and deployment model show red asterisk indicators with amber warning messages |
| **Cloud STT** | OpenAI Whisper API, Azure Cognitive Speech, Deepgram, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, AWS Transcribe (via proxy) — beyond the free browser Web Speech API and offline Whisper WASM |
| **Cloud TTS** | OpenAI TTS, OpenAI Audio Model (translate + speak in 1 call), Azure Speech, ElevenLabs, Google Cloud TTS (WaveNet / Neural2), AWS Polly (via proxy) — premium voices alongside free browser-native narration |
| **Self-Hosted Backends** | Override Core API, Orchestrator, Knowledge Service URLs for private deployments |
| **Export / Import** | Share workshop configs as JSON; import merges with existing settings |
| **Security** | Privacy notes at the top of settings, clear trust banner, no telemetry |

**How to use:** Navigate to **Tools → API Settings** or click the ⚙ gear icon. A 4-step Quick Configuration Guide auto-expands when no keys are configured.

### 🎤 Voice Input — Speak to the Platform

All text inputs now accept **voice dictation** with a microphone button. Engine priority:

1. **Web Speech API** (free, real-time, browser-native)
2. **Whisper WASM** (offline fallback, lazy-loaded ~40 MB model)
3. **Cloud STT** (OpenAI Whisper, Azure Speech, Deepgram, Google Cloud, AWS Transcribe) when configured in BYOK settings

Voice also powers **navigation**: say "go to patterns" or "open study mode" to navigate hands-free.

### 🗂 Mega-Menu Navigation Redesign

The top navigation has been reorganized into **four color-coded categories** with a dropdown mega-menu:

| Category | Color | Contains |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Learn** | Blue → Cyan | Core Concepts, Agent Patterns, Learning Atlas, References |
| **Apply** | Amber → Orange | Agents for Science, Adoption Playbook, Applied AI Skills, Azure Services |
| **Practice** | Emerald → Teal | Study Mode, Knowledge Quiz, Knowledge Search, Community |
| **Tools** | Violet → Purple | API Docs, Agents Console, API Settings |

New items show a pulsing gold badge. Mobile gets a grouped dropdown menu with the same color scheme.

##  Learning Paths

### **Navigation Design Philosophy**

The top navigation uses a **four-category mega-menu** that mirrors the learning lifecycle:

| Category | Purpose |
|----------|--------|
| **Learn** | Foundation — Core Concepts, Agent Patterns, Learning Atlas, References |
| **Apply** | Real-world — Agents for Science, Adoption Playbook, Applied AI Skills, Azure Services |
| **Practice** | Hands-on — Study Mode, Knowledge Quiz, Knowledge Search, Community |
| **Tools** | Config — API Docs, Agents Console, **API Settings (BYOK)** |

**Rationale**: Learners progress from **Learn** (concepts) → **Apply** (real-world use) → **Practice** (exercises) → **Tools** (configure your own environment). The BYOK settings are in Tools so learners can get started immediately without keys and configure providers when they're ready for AI-powered features.
