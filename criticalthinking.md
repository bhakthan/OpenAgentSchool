# Feature Requirements: Critical Thinking Exercises

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Proposed
**Owner:** TBD

## 1. Summary

This document outlines the requirements for a "Critical Thinking Exercise" feature within the AI Agent School. The goal is to deepen the user's understanding by prompting them to apply learned concepts to real-world scenarios. This feature will be integrated into the Core Concepts and Agent Patterns sections of the platform.

## 2. Goals

*   **Enhance Learning:** Move beyond passive consumption of information to active application of knowledge.
*   **Bridge Theory and Practice:** Connect abstract concepts and patterns to tangible, real-world business use cases.
*   **Develop Critical Thinking:** Encourage users to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information in the context of AI agent development.
*   **Increase Engagement:** Provide an interactive element that makes the learning process more dynamic and thought-provoking.

## 3. User Flow

1.  The user is browsing a "Core Concept" (e.g., "Agent Lifecycle") or an "Agent Pattern" (e.g., "ReAct Pattern").
2.  The user clicks a clearly marked button or link, for example, labeled "Apply Your Knowledge" or "Critical Thinking Challenge".
3.  A modal dialog appears on the screen.
4.  The modal presents a context-specific question or scenario.
5.  The user can optionally type their response into a text area within the modal.
6.  The user can copy the question and/or their response to their clipboard.
7.  The user can export the question and their response together as a PDF file.
8.  The user closes the modal when ready.

## 4. Requirements

### 4.1. Trigger Component

*   A button or interactive element will be added to the UI for each relevant Core Concept and Agent Pattern.
*   **Placement:**
    *   **Core Concepts:** The trigger should be present on the main page for each concept and within each of its tabs.
    *   **Agent Patterns:** The trigger should be located alongside the pattern's explanation and visualization.
*   **Iconography:** A distinct icon (e.g., a brain, a lightbulb, a question mark) should be used to make the feature easily recognizable.

### 4.2. Modal Dialog and Interaction

*   The exercise will be presented within a modal popup to avoid navigating the user away from their current context.
*   The modal will contain:
    *   A clear title, e.g., "Critical Thinking Challenge".
    *   The question/scenario text.
    *   A "Copy Question" button that copies the question text to the clipboard.
    *   A multi-line text area for the user to type their response.
    *   A "Copy Response" button that copies the user's text from the text area to the clipboard.
    *   An "Export to PDF" button that generates and downloads a PDF of the question and the user's response.
    *   A "Close" or "Dismiss" button.

*   **Peer/AI Validation:** The primary purpose of the copy and export functionality is to allow users to easily share their thinking process. They can paste the content into an external tool or share the PDF for peer review or validation by another AI.

*   **PDF Export Format:** The exported PDF should be cleanly formatted, including:
    *   The application's logo or name.
    *   The title of the Core Concept or Agent Pattern.
    *   The full text of the question.
    *   The user's complete response.

### 4.3. Content Strategy

*   Each question must be carefully crafted to align with the specific topic.
*   The questions should focus on "why" and "how," prompting analysis rather than simple recall.
*   The scenarios should be relatable to common business or technology problems.

**Example Questions:**

*   **For the "Agent Security" Concept:**
    > **Scenario:** An AI agent is designed to handle customer support for a bank. It has access to user account information to answer balance inquiries.
    > **Question:** What are the top three security vulnerabilities you would be most concerned about, and what specific measures from the "Agent Security" principles would you implement to mitigate them?

*   **For the "Self-Reflection" Agent Pattern:**
    > **Scenario:** You are developing an agent that writes code. After generating a Python function, its first attempt fails with a `TypeError`.
    > **Question:** How would you apply the Self-Reflection pattern here? Describe the "internal monologue" or steps the agent would take to analyze the error, review its own code, and generate a corrected version.

## 5. Brainstorming & Future Ideas (Phase 2)

This section contains ideas for expanding the feature after the initial implementation.

*   **Guided Feedback:**
    *   After a user types a response, they can click a "Get Feedback" button.
    *   This would reveal a sample "expert answer" or a set of key points the user should have considered, allowing for self-assessment.

*   **Gamification:**
    *   Award points or badges for attempting exercises.
    *   Track the number of challenges completed on a user profile or dashboard.

*   **Community-Sourced Content:**
    *   Allow trusted community members to submit their own critical thinking questions for review and inclusion.

*   **Difficulty Levels:**
    *   Introduce different levels of questions (e.g., Foundational, Advanced, Expert) to cater to a wider range of learners.

*   **Hint System:**
    *   Provide optional hints that the user can reveal if they are stuck. These hints could point back to specific sections of the learning material.

*   **Integration with "Enlighten Me":**
    *   Allow users to highlight parts of the question or the expert answer and use the "Enlighten Me" feature to get more clarification.
