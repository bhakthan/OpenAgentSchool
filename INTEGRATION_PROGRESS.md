---

## üéâ MAJOR MILESTONE: Database Seeding Complete!

### Quiz API Verified Working ‚úÖ

**Endpoint Test:**
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/quiz/questions/patterns?limit=3"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "value": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is the primary benefit of the Parallelization pattern?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Reduces memory usage",
        "B": "Improves processing speed for independent tasks",
        "C": "Simplifies code structure",
        "D": "Reduces network latency"
      },
      "difficulty": "medium"
    }
    // ... + 2 more questions
  ],
  "Count": 3
}
```

‚úÖ **10 questions seeded** across 7 categories  
‚úÖ **API returning data correctly**  
‚úÖ **TypeScript client ready to integrate**

- [x] Created barrel exports (`index.ts`)
- [x] Configured environment variables (`.env.local`)
- [x] Build verification (zero TypeScript errors)

### Phase 4: Documentation
- [x] Created `API_ENDPOINTS_DISCOVERED.md` (900 lines)
- [x] Created `FRONTEND_BACKEND_MAPPING.md` (400 lines)
- [x] Created `API_EXPLORATION_CHECKLIST.md` (250 lines)
- [x] Created `QUIZ_DATA_EXPORT_STRATEGY.md` (400 lines)
- [x] Created `WEEK_1_API_CLIENT.md` (600 lines)
- [x] Created `WEEK_1_COMPLETE.md` (650 lines)
- [x] Created `WEEK_1_STATUS.md` (summary)

## üéØ CURRENT STATUS

### Backend Services
- ‚úÖ Core API (8000): Healthy - Quiz, auth, progress endpoints
- ‚úÖ Agent Orchestrator (8002): Alive - Critical thinking, frameworks
- ‚úÖ Knowledge Service (8003): Healthy - Concepts, semantic search

### TypeScript API Client
- ‚úÖ Base client: Axios + interceptors + token management
- ‚úÖ Auth API: register, login, logout, isAuthenticated
- ‚úÖ Quiz API: getQuestions, submitQuiz, getResults
- ‚úÖ Progress API: getProgress, updateProgress
- ‚úÖ Type definitions: All request/response types defined
- ‚úÖ Environment: `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000`
- ‚úÖ Build: Zero TypeScript errors, production bundle ready

### Database Status
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **BLOCKER**: Quiz database empty (needs seeding)
- Scripts created: `scripts/seed-quiz-database.py`
- Issue: Missing DuckDB driver in local environment
- Workaround: Execute in Docker or install `duckdb-engine`

## ‚è≥ REMAINING TASKS (2-3 hours)

### API Endpoints
- [ ] What quiz endpoints are actually implemented?
- [ ] Do they match frontend expectations?
- [ ] What's the authentication method (JWT/API key)?
- [ ] What's the request/response format?

### Data Model
- [ ] What quiz data is in the database?
- [ ] Is sample data loaded?
- [ ] Do we need to ingest data?
- [ ] What's the quiz state model?

### Authentication
- [ ] Is auth required for quiz endpoints?
- [ ] How do we get a JWT token?
- [ ] Is there a test/dev user?

### Integration Gaps
- [ ] What's missing in the backend?
- [ ] What needs frontend changes?
- [ ] Any data format mismatches?

## üìù Documentation To Create

Based on discoveries:

1. **API Integration Guide**
   - Request/response examples
   - Authentication flow
   - Error handling

2. **Data Ingestion Guide**
   - How to load quiz data
   - Data format requirements
   - Sample data creation

3. **Frontend Integration Pattern**
   - TypeScript API client
   - React hooks for quiz data
   - Error handling patterns

## üêõ Issues Encountered

### Issue 1: Incorrect Script Paths
**Problem:** Scripts referenced `$PSScriptRoot` assuming services were inside OpenAgentSchool  
**Solution:** Changed to hardcoded `C:\code\openagent-backend` path  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed

### Issue 2: [Pending Discovery]
**Problem:** TBD  
**Solution:** TBD  
**Status:** ‚è≥

## üéØ Success Criteria

**Week 1 Goal:** One feature working end-to-end (Quiz System)

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] All three backend services running
- [ ] API endpoints documented
- [ ] Frontend calls backend successfully
- [ ] Quiz data flows from backend to frontend
- [ ] Authentication working
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Basic integration tests passing

---

## üí° Learnings & Notes

### Build Process
- Core API builds relatively fast (~47 seconds)
- Agent Orchestrator has large dependencies (PyTorch ~888MB)
- First build takes longer; subsequent builds use cache

### Service Architecture
- Each service builds independently in Docker
- Health checks validate service readiness
- Services can start in any order (no hard dependencies)

### Development Workflow
- Scripts should be run from OpenAgentSchool directory
- Backend services live in separate repository
- Multi-root workspace makes navigation easier

**Last Updated:** September 30, 2025 (During initial service startup)  
**Next Update:** After all services are running and health checks pass
