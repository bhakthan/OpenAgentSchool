Welcome to Agent Integration Patterns. This page is about how AI agents connect to the outside world. An agent isn't very useful if it's stuck in a box; it needs to connect to other apps, websites, and data sources to get its job done. This page shows you the different ways agents can make these connections. The main way is through "APIs," which are like standardized plugs that let different software systems talk to each other.

This page explores the different ways AI agents can be integrated into larger software ecosystems. The "API Integration" tab covers the most common methods, like REST APIs, GraphQL, and Webhooks. The "Event-Driven Architecture" tab explains a more advanced pattern where agents react to events as they happen, which is great for real-time applications. The other tabs, "Microservices" and "Legacy System Integration," cover how agents can fit into modern, cloud-based applications or connect to older, existing enterprise systems.

Advanced Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agent integration involves connecting agents to external systems, a process governed by software architecture patterns. API integration is the most common, using REST, GraphQL, or gRPC protocols. For real-time, asynchronous communication, an Event-Driven Architecture is often employed, where agents act as event producers or consumers, communicating via a central message broker like Kafka or RabbitMQ. This decouples the agent from the systems it interacts with, improving scalability and resilience. When integrating with modern, cloud-native applications, agents are often deployed as microservices within a larger distributed system. For legacy systems, an "Adapter" or "Facade" pattern is used, creating a modern API interface that the agent can interact with, which then translates the calls into the format required by the older system. Securely managing credentials for these integrations is critical, typically handled by a dedicated secrets management service like Azure Key Vault or HashiCorp Vault.
