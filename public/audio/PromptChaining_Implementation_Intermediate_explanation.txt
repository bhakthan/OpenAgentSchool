At the intermediate level, implementing the Chain of Thought pattern moves beyond simple prompt engineering and into a more structured, code-driven approach. This allows for more complex and reliable reasoning, especially when interacting with external tools or data sources.

The core of this implementation is a loop that manages the conversation between the AI and other systems. Let's break down the key components. First, you have a state manager. This is a variable or object in your code, perhaps a dictionary or a list, that keeps track of the entire conversation history, including the initial prompt, each of the AI's thoughts, and the results of any actions taken.

Second, you have the reasoning agent. This is a function that takes the current state as input, formats it into a prompt for the large language model, and sends it to a service like Azure OpenAI. The prompt at this level is more sophisticated. It will typically include the full conversation history to give the AI context, and a clear instruction on what to do next. For example, it might ask the AI to generate its next thought based on the last piece of information received.

Third, you have a tool execution engine. The AI's thought is not just text, it is an instruction. For example, the thought might be, I need to look up the current price of stock XYZ. The tool execution engine parses this thought, identifies the intent, which is to get a stock price, and calls the appropriate function or API to get that information. This might involve making a call to a financial data service.

Fourth, the result from the tool is then passed back to the state manager, which appends it to the conversation history. The loop then repeats. The reasoning agent takes the updated history, which now includes the stock price, and generates the next thought. This might be, now that I have the price, I will compare it to the 52 week high.

This entire process is often wrapped in a class or a set of functions that manage the flow. For example, you might have a main orchestrator function that runs the loop until a certain condition is met, such as the AI generating a final answer.

To make this robust, you also need to implement error handling. What happens if the tool call fails? The tool execution engine should catch the error and report it back to the reasoning agent. The AI can then decide what to do next, such as trying a different tool or asking the user for help. This implementation, using a stateful loop and tool integration, allows the Chain of Thought pattern to solve much more complex, real world problems. It is a common pattern in applications built with frameworks like LangChain or Semantic Kernel, and is often deployed on scalable infrastructure like Azure Container Instances.
