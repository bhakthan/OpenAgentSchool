Fine Tuning Concept Unified Narration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beginner Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to fine tuning basics. Think of three layers of teaching a model.
First, Supervised Fine Tuning or S F T: you simply show input and the ideal output. The model copies style, format, and safe behaviours. It is imitation.
Second, Direct Preference Optimization or D P O: for the same input you give two outputs, a good one and a bad one. The model is pushed to prefer the good one. It learns a delta: more like this, less like that. No separate reward model needed.
Third, Reinforcement Fine Tuning or R F T: now we introduce a reward signal â€” maybe a learned reward model or programmatic checks. The model explores, gets scored, and adjusts while staying near a reference. Here we often encourage reasoning steps like chain of thought. Summarize: S F T imitates; D P O differentiates; R F T reasons and optimizes with feedback.

Intermediate fine tuning view.
Stage one S F T locks in formatting, tone, safety disclaimers, and reduces prompt verbosity. Key success signals: stable validation loss, improved style conformity, lower hallucination rate.
Stage two D P O sharpens preferences. You curate prompt plus chosen and rejected responses. Optimization directly increases the log probability gap in favour of chosen samples while controlling K L divergence to a reference. Watch win rate, K L drift, and regression on a held out supervised slice.
Stage three R F T introduces a scalar reward: often a mixture of helpfulness, correctness tests, safety filters, and maybe latency penalties. Use policy optimization like PPO with a K L penalty to prevent collapse. Monitor reward trend, K L band, and catastrophic forgetting (rise in supervised loss). Exit criteria: marginal reward gain falls below operational cost or quality regresses on business benchmarks.
Rule of thumb: Do not escalate past S F T unless remaining error modes are preference based. Do not escalate past D P O unless you need composite or long-horizon signals.

Advanced fine tuning walkthrough.
Pipeline maturity hinges on: data curation quality, isolation of evaluation slices, adaptive regularization, and rollback safety.
Supervised Fine Tuning: treat as schema consolidation. Enforce deterministic preprocessing, aggressive dedupe (semantic plus exact), and train with conservative learning rate schedule. Maintain a style regression set: any post D P O or R F T step must not degrade its loss.
Direct Preference Optimization: engineer high information pairs. Avoid strawman negatives. Beta tuning trades off sharpness versus stability. Actively monitor preference win rate, K L divergence to the S F T reference, and calibration of any automated judge. Implement continuous pair refresh to prevent overfitting.
Reinforcement Fine Tuning: design a decomposed reward vector: e.g., accuracy, reasoning depth proxy, safety, format adherence. Log raw components, their weighted sum, and moving averages. Use adaptive K L targeting: increase penalty when divergence spikes or style regression loss rises. Deploy automated rollback triggers tied to benchmark regression or safety drift.
Governance: version manifests linking base model hash, S F T dataset snapshot, D P O pair manifest, reward model commit, and hyperparameters. Shadow deploy R F T candidates behind traffic sampling and require statistically significant lift on primary metrics before promotion.
Exit criteria: additional policy updates produce diminishing composite reward gains AND incremental compute cost is no longer justified by business impact.
Summary: S F T stabilizes form, D P O sculpts preference gradients, R F T performs constrained exploration guided by explicit reward decomposition.
