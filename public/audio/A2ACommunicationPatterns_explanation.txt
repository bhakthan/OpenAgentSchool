A2A Communication Patterns Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A2A Protocol v1.0 RC - Linux Foundation Standard
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The A2A Protocol is now an open standard under the Linux Foundation governance, with contributions from Google, Microsoft, IBM, AWS, Cisco, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and SAP. IBM's Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) merged into A2A in August 2025.

Beginner Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Imagine a team of experts working on a big project. You have a project manager, a writer, a designer, and a researcher. They don't all work in isolation. The project manager gives tasks to everyone, and the team members talk to each other to get the job done. For example, the writer might ask the researcher for some data, and the designer might show the writer a new logo.

Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication is just like that, but for AI agents. You have a team of specialized AI agents, and they can talk to each other to solve problems. One "coordinator" agent might break a big task into smaller pieces and assign them to "specialist" agents. These specialists can then work together, share information, and combine their results to complete the project.

In A2A v1.0, each agent has an "Agent Card" - like a digital business card - that tells other agents what skills it has and how to communicate with it. The protocol tracks task status (Submitted, Working, Completed, etc.) so everyone knows what's happening.

Intermediate Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication v1.0 RC is a standardized pattern for multi-agent systems where autonomous agents interact to achieve common goals. The protocol defines a 3-layer architecture:
- Canonical Data Model (Protocol Buffers): Core structures like Task, Message, AgentCard, Part, Artifact
- Abstract Operations: SendMessage, GetTask, ListTasks, CancelTask, SubscribeToTask
- Protocol Bindings: JSON-RPC 2.0, gRPC, HTTP+JSON/REST

Communication patterns demonstrated include Direct (one-to-one), Broadcast (one-to-many), and Hierarchical (coordinator-to-workers). Each pattern now uses contextId for multi-turn conversation grouping. For example:

```python
client = A2AClient("https://research-agent.example.com")
result = await client.send_message(
    message={"content": "Find Q3 sales data"},
    context_id="research-123",  # Groups related tasks
    task_id="task-456"
)
```

Task states in v1.0 include: SUBMITTED, WORKING, COMPLETED, FAILED, CANCELED, INPUT_REQUIRED, AUTH_REQUIRED, and REJECTED. The INPUT_REQUIRED and AUTH_REQUIRED states enable interactive, multi-turn workflows where agents can request additional information or authentication from users.

Agent Cards advertise capabilities with new v1.0 fields: supportedInterfaces (protocol bindings), capabilities (streaming, pushNotifications, extendedAgentCard), and securitySchemes for OAuth2 or API key authentication.

Advanced Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication v1.0 RC is a fundamental pattern for building sophisticated multi-agent systems under Linux Foundation governance. The architecture uses a 3-layer design ensuring interoperability across different implementations.

Layer 1 - Canonical Data Model (Protocol Buffers):
- Task: Core work unit with state tracking
- Message: Communication payload with Parts
- AgentCard: Capability advertisement and endpoint discovery
- Part: Content units (text, files, structured data)
- Artifact: Task outputs and deliverables
- Extension: Custom capability extensions

Layer 2 - Abstract Operations:
- SendMessage: Initiate or continue task communication
- GetTask: Retrieve task status and results
- ListTasks: Query tasks with filtering
- CancelTask: Request task cancellation
- SubscribeToTask: Real-time task updates (streaming)
- Push Notification Configuration: Webhook setup for async updates

Layer 3 - Protocol Bindings:
- JSON-RPC 2.0: HTTP with SSE for streaming, familiar web patterns
- gRPC: High-performance binary protocol with server streaming
- HTTP+JSON/REST: Simple RESTful API for basic integrations

Communication patterns supported:
1. Direct (P2P): One-to-one agent communication with context preservation
2. Broadcast: One-to-many notification with topic-based routing
3. Hierarchical: Coordinator/worker delegation with task decomposition

Key v1.0 features:
- contextId for multi-turn conversation grouping across task boundaries
- 8 task states: SUBMITTED, WORKING, COMPLETED, FAILED, CANCELED, INPUT_REQUIRED, AUTH_REQUIRED, REJECTED
- Agent Card schema with supportedInterfaces, capabilities, securitySchemes
- Breaking changes: "kind" discriminator removed, extendedAgentCard moved to capabilities object

Official SDKs at github.com/a2aproject: Python (a2a-python), JavaScript (a2a-js), Java (a2a-java), C#/.NET (a2a-dotnet), Go (a2a-go).

Error handling patterns include circuit breakers, graceful degradation, and retry with exponential backoff. The protocol supports both synchronous request/response and asynchronous push notification workflows for long-running tasks.
