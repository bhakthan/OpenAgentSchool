Beginner Explanation

Welcome to the Agent Communication Protocol, or ACP. Think of ACP as the enterprise-level version of agent communication. If basic A2A is like a small team having a conversation, ACP is like the communication system for a whole corporation. It's designed for bigger, more complex tasks and includes features for managing complex workflows and ensuring everything runs smoothly and reliably, which is essential for businesses. On the screen, you can see how ACP compares to other protocols, showing that it's built for advanced coordination.

This page introduces the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), an advanced stack for multi-agent systems. As you can see in the "ACP vs Other Protocols" section, while A2A handles basic messaging and MCP handles secure tool use, ACP is designed for orchestrating complex workflows. When you click the "Protocol Stack" tab, you'll see that ACP is a layered system. It includes layers for the application, orchestration, communication, and transport, each handling a different part of the process. The interactive demos on this page will let you see a simplified ACP workflow in action and compare it directly with MCP.

Advanced Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) is an advanced, layered communication stack designed for enterprise-grade multi-agent systems, emphasizing reliability and complex workflow orchestration. Unlike simpler protocols, ACP defines a formal protocol stack, typically including: 1) a Transport Layer (e.g., HTTP/S, gRPC) for data transmission, 2) a Communication Layer that formats messages using a defined schema, 3) an Orchestration Layer that manages multi-step, transactional workflows (often implementing patterns like the Saga pattern to handle distributed transactions without locking), and 4) an Application Layer where the specific business logic resides. A key feature of ACP is its built-in support for advanced software architecture patterns like Circuit Breakers, which prevent cascading failures, and Bulkheads, which isolate resources to prevent a single faulty agent from impacting the entire system. This makes ACP suitable for mission-critical applications where fault tolerance and transactional integrity are paramount.
