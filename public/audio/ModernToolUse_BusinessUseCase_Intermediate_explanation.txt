At the intermediate level, the Tool Use pattern can be applied to streamline and automate more complex business workflows that require interaction with multiple systems. A powerful business use case is in sales and customer relationship management, specifically in lead qualification and follow-up.

A sales team often deals with a high volume of incoming leads from various channels, like website forms, emails, and events. A multi-tool AI agent can be built to handle the initial processing of these leads, allowing the sales team to focus on the most promising opportunities.

The agent would be equipped with a set of tools. For example, a crm_lookup tool to check if a lead already exists in the company's CRM like Salesforce or Dynamics 365. A data_enrichment tool that uses a service like Clearbit to find more information about a lead, such as their company size and industry. And a communication tool that can send templated emails.

When a new lead comes in, the agent's workflow begins. First, it uses the crm_lookup tool to see if the person is already a known contact. If they are, the agent might update their record with the new inquiry.

If it is a new lead, the agent's next step is to use the data_enrichment tool. It takes the lead's email address and gets more context. This is crucial for prioritization. A lead from a large company in a key industry might be more valuable than one from a small company in a different sector.

Based on the enriched data, the agent can then perform an initial qualification. It might have a set of rules, for example, if the company has more than 500 employees and is in the technology sector, classify it as a high-priority lead.

Finally, the agent uses its communication tool to take action. For a high-priority lead, it might send a notification directly to a senior sales representative on Microsoft Teams. For a lower-priority lead, it might automatically send a welcome email with a link to a webinar, and schedule a follow-up task in the CRM for one week later.

This entire process, which would take a human several minutes per lead, is done automatically in seconds. The business benefits are significant. It ensures that every lead is processed instantly and consistently, 24 hours a day. It allows the sales team to focus their time and effort on the leads that are most likely to convert, increasing their efficiency and effectiveness. And it provides a better experience for potential customers, who get a prompt and relevant response. This kind of workflow automation is a perfect example of how multi-tool agents can deliver tangible business value.
