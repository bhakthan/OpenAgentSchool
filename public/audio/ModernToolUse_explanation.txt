Modern Tool Use Pattern Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beginner Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Imagine you have a smart assistant, but instead of just being able to talk, it can also use a bunch of different apps on your computer, like a calculator, a calendar, and a web browser. This is what "Tool Use" is for an AI agent. It's the ability for the agent to use external "tools" to get things done.

"Modern Tool Use" takes this a step further. The agent isn't just using one tool at a time. It can create a plan that involves using multiple tools in a sequence. For example, to answer the question "What's the weather like in the city where my next meeting is?", the agent would first use the calendar tool to find the location of the next meeting, and then use the weather tool with that location to get the forecast. It can also handle errors. If a tool fails, it can try again or use a different tool to accomplish the task. This makes the agent much more powerful and reliable.

The Modern Tool Use pattern describes an advanced framework where an AI agent can intelligently plan, select, and execute a sequence of tools to accomplish a task. This goes beyond simple function calling by incorporating logic for multi-step workflows and error handling.

The key components of this pattern are:
1.  Tool Planner: When the agent receives a task, it first uses an LLM to create a step-by-step plan of which tools to use and in what order. For example, the plan might be: "Step 1: Use `get_portfolio` to fetch holdings. Step 2: Use `get_quote` for each of the top 3 holdings. Step 3: Use `compute_risk` with the holdings data."
2.  Tool Selector: This component is responsible for choosing the correct tool from a library of available tools based on the current step in the plan.
3.  Tool Executor: This component actually makes the call to the tool (e.g., an API call) with the correct parameters.
4.  Result Validator: After a tool is executed, this component checks if the result is valid and in the expected format. If not, it can trigger the error handler.
5.  Error Handler: If a tool fails (e.g., an API is down, invalid parameters), this component is invoked. It can implement strategies like retrying the tool, or it can even use an LLM to reason about the error and suggest an alternative tool or a different approach.

This pattern allows for the creation of robust and resilient agents that can reliably interact with external systems to solve complex, multi-step problems.

Advanced Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Modern Tool Use pattern is a sophisticated agentic architecture for orchestrating interactions with a library of external tools. The system is designed to be dynamic, resilient, and capable of executing complex, multi-step workflows.

The architecture is built around a central orchestrator that manages the following stages:
1.  Planning: Given a user task, the orchestrator first calls an LLM with a "planning" prompt. This prompt includes the user's task and a list of all available tools with their descriptions and parameters (often in a format similar to the OpenAPI specification). The LLM's task is to return a structured plan, typically a JSON array of steps, where each step specifies the `tool` to be called and the `params` to be used. The plan can also include placeholders for dependencies (e.g., using the output of step 1 as an input for step 3).
2.  Execution Loop: The orchestrator iterates through the steps of the plan. For each step, it invokes the specified tool with the given parameters. It handles dependency injection by substituting placeholders in the parameters with the results from previous steps.
3.  Validation: After each tool execution, a "validator" function can be called. This function checks if the output of the tool is in the expected format and meets certain quality criteria. If validation fails, it can trigger the error handling mechanism.
4.  Error Handling and Recovery: This is a critical component. When a tool execution fails or validation fails, the orchestrator invokes an "error handler." This handler can implement simple retry logic with exponential backoff. In more advanced setups, it can make another LLM call, providing the context of the failed step and the error message, and ask the LLM to generate a "recovery plan." This might involve trying a different tool, using different parameters, or modifying the rest of the plan.
5.  Synthesis: After all the steps in the plan have been successfully executed, the orchestrator makes a final LLM call to synthesize all the results from the individual tool calls into a single, coherent response for the user.

This pattern moves beyond simple, reactive function calling to a more proactive, planned approach, which is essential for building production-grade, reliable agentic systems.
