MCP Apps fundamentals build on three core concepts that work together to enable interactive agent UIs.

First, ui:// resources. These are HTML templates served by your MCP server with a special MIME type: text/html;profile=mcp-app. This profile tells hosts that this isn't just HTML—it's an MCP App that needs the proper sandboxed rendering environment.

Second, tool annotations. When you define an MCP tool, you link it to a UI using the _meta.ui.resourceUri annotation. For example, your list_feature_flags tool would have an annotation pointing to ui://feature-flags. When the tool runs, the host knows to render that UI with the tool's output.

Third, the Host-App communication channel. The host and app talk through structured postMessage calls. The host sends ui/initialize with theme and context, then ui/notifications/tool-input with the actual data. The app can send ui/message back to request actions.

This separation keeps your interactive UIs secure while enabling rich functionality across all MCP-compatible platforms.
