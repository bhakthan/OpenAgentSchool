Beginner Explanation

Welcome to the Agent Evaluation page. This is all about how we "grade" AI agents to make sure they're doing a good job. Just like a student gets a report card, an AI agent is tested to see how well it performs. We check things like its accuracy, how well it handles tricky situations, and whether it's safe to use. This helps developers find areas for improvement and build better, more reliable agents.

This page provides a comprehensive guide to evaluating AI agents. The "Architecture" tab explains the overall strategy, which includes automated benchmarking and getting feedback from human reviewers. The "Implementation" tab shows real code examples of how to use evaluation tools like the "Azure AI Evaluation SDK" to test an agent's performance. The "Business Use Case" tab gives a practical example of why this is important, showing how a retail company would evaluate a shopping assistant agent. Finally, the "Simulation" tab includes advanced visualizations of different evaluation methods, like "LLM as a Judge," where one AI is used to grade another.

Advanced Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agent evaluation is a multi-faceted discipline that goes beyond simple accuracy metrics. A key technique is "LLM-as-a-Judge," where a powerful, separate LLM is used to score an agent's output against a predefined rubric, assessing qualities like coherence, helpfulness, and factual consistency. For evaluating agents that use tools, the focus is on the correctness of the tool call (right tool, right parameters) and the agent's ability to recover from tool errors. In multi-agent systems, evaluation becomes even more complex, measuring not just the final outcome but also the efficiency of the collaboration, such as communication overhead and resource contention. Advanced evaluation frameworks often use "simulation-based testing," creating dynamic environments where the agent must react to a series of events, allowing for the assessment of its planning and adaptation capabilities in a controlled, repeatable manner. These evaluations are typically automated in a CI/CD pipeline to prevent performance regressions.
