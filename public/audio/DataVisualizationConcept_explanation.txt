MCP Apps & Agent UI Concept Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beginner Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the MCP Apps & Agent UI page. This is about how we build interactive user interfaces that work directly inside AI chat interfaces like Claude, ChatGPT, and VS Code Copilot. Instead of just text responses, agents can now show you rich visual tools—like flame graphs for debugging, feature flag editors, or workflow builders—right in the conversation. The magic is in something called ui:// resources, which are HTML templates that AI hosts can safely render. This page introduces you to the MCP Apps extension, also known as SEP-1865, which became the standard in January 2026.

Intermediate Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This page explores how MCP Apps enable interactive UIs in AI agent systems. The "MCP Apps Fundamentals" tab introduces the core concepts: ui:// resources serve HTML with a special MIME type (text/html;profile=mcp-app) that tells hosts to render them in sandboxed iframes. Tools link to these UIs through the _meta.ui.resourceUri annotation. The "Architecture" tab shows how the Host-to-App communication works: the host sends ui/initialize with theme and context, then ui/notifications/tool-input with the tool's data. The app can send ui/message back to request actions. The "Implementation" tab provides step-by-step code examples using the @mcp-ui/client and @mcp-ui/server SDKs.

Advanced Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MCP Apps represent a paradigm shift in AI agent interfaces, moving from text-only to rich interactive experiences while maintaining strict security boundaries. The architecture follows a capability-based security model: apps run in sandboxed iframes with no access to parent frame, localStorage, or cookies. All communication happens through a structured postMessage channel defined in SEP-1865. Advanced patterns include handling large data visualization (streaming, virtual scrolling), implementing bidirectional actions (where UI gestures trigger host tool calls), and building cross-platform apps that adapt to different hosts' theme systems and capabilities. The "Security & Best Practices" tab covers template pre-auditing, user consent flows for sensitive actions, and testing strategies using the mcp-apps-playground environment.
