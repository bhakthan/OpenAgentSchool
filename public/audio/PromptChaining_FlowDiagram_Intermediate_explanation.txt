At the intermediate level, the Chain of Thought flow diagram reveals a more detailed and interactive process. It is not just a linear progression but a dynamic loop that often involves clarification and refinement. This view of the pattern is less about a simple input to output path and more about a collaborative reasoning process between the user and the AI.

The flow begins with an initial prompt, which is often a complex query that cannot be answered in a single step. The first major component is the reasoning module, typically powered by a large language model on a service like Azure OpenAI. This module's primary task is to generate an initial thought. This thought is an explicit statement of the immediate step the AI will take to address a part of the query. For example, if asked to summarize a long document, the first thought might be, I will first read the introduction to understand the main topic.

This thought is then passed to an execution engine. This is where the flow diagram becomes more complex. The execution engine might perform an action, like reading a file, or it might determine that more information is needed. The result of this action, whether it is a piece of data or a new question, is then fed back into the reasoning module. This creates a feedback loop. The AI now has a new piece of information to consider, which informs its next thought.

This cycle of thought, action, and observation continues until the AI determines it has gathered enough information to answer the original query. Each step in this process is explicitly logged, creating the chain of thought. This log is not just for auditing, it is an active part of the reasoning process. The AI can refer back to previous steps in the chain to maintain context and ensure its reasoning remains coherent.

A key feature at this level is the ability to handle multi-turn conversations. The user can interject at any point, providing clarification or new information. The flow diagram shows how this user input is integrated into the reasoning loop, allowing the AI to adjust its plan on the fly. This makes the Chain of Thought pattern a powerful tool for interactive problem solving, where the AI and the user work together to reach a solution. The entire process is orchestrated and scaled using cloud services like Azure Functions for serverless execution and Azure Cosmos DB for storing the conversation history and reasoning steps.
