Welcome to MCP Apps & Agent UI! This is the 2026 standard for building interactive interfaces that work directly inside AI chat applications like Claude, ChatGPT, and VS Code Copilot.

Instead of just text responses, AI agents can now show you rich visual tools right in the conversation. Imagine debugging a slow API call and seeing an interactive flame graph you can zoom and click, or managing feature flags with toggles you can flip directly in chat.

The key concept is the ui:// resource. This is a special type of HTML template that AI hosts know how to render safely. When you create a ui://flamegraph resource, any MCP-compatible host can display it.

MCP Apps are part of the SEP-1865 specification, which became stable in January 2026. Write once, and your UI works in Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, VS Code, Goose, and other compatible clients.
