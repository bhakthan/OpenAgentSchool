Welcome to Multi-Agent Systems. This page is about how you can get multiple AI agents to work together as a team to solve problems that would be too big for a single agent. Just like a human team, agent teams need ways to coordinate their work, and this page explores how they do that. For example, they use "Coordination Mechanisms" to avoid stepping on each other's toes and "Negotiation" to decide how to share resources or divide up tasks.

This page dives into the concepts behind building and managing multi-agent systems. The "Coordination Mechanisms" tab explains patterns like "Consensus Algorithms" for group decisions and "Task Allocation" for distributing work. The "Agent Negotiation" tab covers strategies like "Auction-Based" negotiation, where agents can bid on tasks. The "Collaboration Models" tab shows different team structures, like a "Hierarchical Model" with a manager and workers, or a "Peer-to-Peer Model" where all agents are equal. The page also introduces Microsoft's "AutoGen Framework," a popular tool for building these kinds of multi-agent applications.

Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are a subfield of AI focused on the computational study of societies of autonomous agents. At a technical level, designing a MAS involves addressing several core challenges:

1.  Communication and Interaction Protocols: Effective coordination requires a standardized Agent Communication Language (ACL). Historically, FIPA-ACL has been a standard, defining message types like `inform`, `query`, and `propose`. Modern systems often use simpler, web-friendly protocols like REST APIs, gRPC, or message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ) for inter-agent communication, with message payloads structured in JSON.

2.  Coordination Mechanisms: Beyond simple messaging, agents need algorithms to coordinate their actions. This can involve distributed algorithms for task allocation, such as the Contract Net Protocol, where an "initiator" agent advertises a task, other agents "bid" on it, and the initiator awards the contract. For achieving agreement in the presence of faults, consensus algorithms like Paxos or Raft can be adapted for agent decision-making.

3.  Negotiation and Game Theory: When agents have conflicting objectives but must still cooperate, negotiation strategies are key. These are often modeled using game theory. Auction mechanisms (e.g., Vickrey auctions) can be used for resource allocation, while bargaining models can be used for more direct, one-to-one negotiation.

4.  Agent Architectures: The internal architecture of each agent is crucial. A classic and influential model is the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) architecture, where an agent's behavior is driven by its beliefs about the world, its desires (goals), and its intentions (committed plans).

Frameworks like Microsoft's AutoGen, CrewAI, and LangGraph provide high-level abstractions that handle many of these complexities, such as managing conversation state, orchestrating agent turn-taking, and providing tools for defining agent roles and capabilities.
