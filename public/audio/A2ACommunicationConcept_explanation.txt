A2ACommunicationConcept Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beginner Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the Agent-to-Agent, or A2A, Communication page. Think of this as learning how to get AI assistants to work together as a team. Instead of one AI trying to do everything, A2A allows them to talk to each other, share work, and combine their skills. 

A2A is now an open standard under the Linux Foundation, with major companies like Google, Microsoft, IBM, AWS, and Salesforce contributing to its development. In August 2025, IBM's Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) merged into A2A, making it the unified standard for agent interoperability.

On your screen, you'll see why this is so important: it allows AIs to specialize in what they're good at, handle bigger tasks, and be more efficient, just like a well-organized human team. 

In the Multi-agent Systems tab, you'll see an amazing visual simulation showing three AI agents working together: a Customer Service Agent, a Product Research Agent, and an Order Management Agent. Watch how they use A2A protocol to pass messages, GenAI processors to think and reason, and MCP to connect to tools and databases. Each step shows the task state - from "Submitted" when a request comes in, to "Working" as agents process, to "Completed" when results are delivered.

Intermediate Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This page explores the fundamentals of how AI agents collaborate through the A2A Protocol v1.0 Release Candidate. We'll cover the core architectural components that make this possible, such as Agent Cards that advertise each agent's capabilities, Task lifecycle management with states like submitted, working, completed, failed, canceled, input_required, auth_required, and rejected.

A2A v1.0 uses a 3-layer architecture: a Canonical Data Model defined in Protocol Buffers, Abstract Operations that are binding-agnostic, and Protocol Bindings for JSON-RPC 2.0, gRPC, and HTTP+JSON/REST. The contextId feature allows related tasks to be grouped for multi-turn conversations.

The Multi-agent Systems visual simulation demonstrates real A2A communication in action. Watch the task states change in real-time: when authentication is needed, the state becomes AUTH_REQUIRED; when the agent is processing, it's WORKING; and when complete, the artifact is delivered with COMPLETED status. This replaces the old way of just searching through documents with intelligent, coordinated agent collaboration.

Advanced Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication in v1.0 is technically realized through a structured 3-layer architecture. Layer 1 is the Canonical Data Model using Protocol Buffers to define core structures: Task, Message, AgentCard, Part, Artifact, and Extension. Layer 2 defines Abstract Operations like SendMessage, GetTask, ListTasks, CancelTask, SubscribeToTask, and Push Notification Configuration. Layer 3 provides Protocol Bindings for JSON-RPC 2.0 (with SSE streaming), gRPC (with server streaming), and HTTP+JSON/REST.

The Agent Card schema has evolved significantly in v1.0. Key fields now include supportedInterfaces (specifying protocolBinding and protocolVersion), capabilities (streaming, pushNotifications, extendedAgentCard), defaultInputModes/defaultOutputModes, and securitySchemes for OAuth2, API keys, or other auth mechanisms.

Breaking changes from earlier versions include: the removal of the "kind" discriminator in union types (now using wrapper objects), and the relocation of supportsExtendedAgentCard to capabilities.extendedAgentCard.

The Multi-agent Systems implementation showcases enterprise-grade architecture patterns. Task states now cover the full lifecycle: SUBMITTED, WORKING, INPUT_REQUIRED, AUTH_REQUIRED, COMPLETED, FAILED, CANCELED, and REJECTED. The contextId enables multi-turn interactions and maintains conversational continuity across task boundaries. Push notifications via webhooks allow for truly asynchronous, long-running workflows.

Official SDKs are available under the a2aproject GitHub organization: Python (a2a-python), JavaScript (a2a-js), Java (a2a-java), C#/.NET (a2a-dotnet), and Go (a2a-go).

Protocol Governance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The A2A Protocol is now governed by the Linux Foundation with a Technical Steering Committee including representatives from Google, Microsoft, IBM, AWS, Cisco, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and SAP. IBM's Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) officially merged into A2A in August 2025, bringing together enterprise orchestration features and the BeeAI platform expertise. BeeAI users can migrate using the A2AServer adapter to make agents A2A-compliant, and A2AAgent to integrate external A2A agents.
