MCPxA2AIntegrationConcept Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beginner Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This page explains how two key agent technologies, MCP and A2A, work together. Think of A2A as the communication system for a team of agents, allowing them to delegate big tasks. MCP is the system that lets an agent use a specific tool. By integrating them, you can build a team of agents where one agent can securely ask another agent to use its special tools. This allows for more powerful and flexible teams of agents.

This page explores the integration of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol. The "Integration Flow" tab features an interactive visualization that shows how an "Orchestrator Agent" can use A2A to send a task to a "Tool Agent." The Tool Agent then uses MCP to securely access a database. This demonstrates how A2A is used for high-level coordination between agents, while MCP is used for the low-level, secure execution of a specific tool or function.

This `MCPxA2AIntegrationConcept` component explains the architectural pattern of composing A2A and MCP. The 'Implementation Guide' tab includes a JavaScript pseudo-code example for an `MCPToA2ABridge` class. This class shows how an A2A agent can discover the tools available on an MCP server and register them as capabilities in the A2A network. The `invokeMCPTool` method within the bridge acts as a proxy, translating an A2A capability request into a specific MCP tool call and returning the result, effectively and securely exposing an agent's tools to other agents in the network.
