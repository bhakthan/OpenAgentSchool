This page is all about keeping AI agents safe and secure. Just like we need security for our online accounts, AI agents need security to protect them and the data they use. This page covers the basics, like "Agent Authentication," which is like a password for an agent to prove it is who it says it is. It also covers "Secure Communication," which means making sure the messages between agents are encrypted so no one else can read them, and "Privacy Protection," which is about making sure the agent handles user data responsibly.

This page provides a comprehensive overview of agent security. The "Agent Authentication" tab explains the different ways agents can verify their identities, such as with digital signatures or tokens. The "Trust Networks" tab discusses how agents can build trust with each other over time based on their reliability and performance. "Secure Communication" covers the technical side of protecting the messages sent between agents, and "Privacy Protection" explains advanced techniques like "Differential Privacy" and "Homomorphic Encryption" that allow agents to work with data while protecting the privacy of individuals.

Agent security is a multi-layered discipline that addresses threats unique to autonomous AI systems. Agent Authentication is often implemented using standards like OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect, where agents are treated as clients that must obtain access tokens to interact with other services. For establishing trust in a decentralized system, a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) can be used, where each agent has a signed digital certificate. Secure Communication is achieved through transport-level encryption (TLS). For protecting data in use, advanced techniques like Homomorphic Encryption, which allows computation on encrypted data, or Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC), which allows multiple agents to compute a joint function without revealing their private inputs, are emerging as key technologies. These cryptographic methods are computationally expensive but provide strong guarantees for privacy and security in high-stakes environments.
