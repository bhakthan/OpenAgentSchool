This page is all about how AI agents are "deployed," which is how they are put into a live environment where they can do their work. A key technology for this is "Containerization." Think of a container like a standardized shipping container for software. It packages up the agent and everything it needs to run, so it can be easily moved and run on any computer or cloud server. This makes deploying and managing agents much more reliable and efficient.

This page covers the key concepts for deploying and managing AI agents in a production environment. The first tab, "Containerization," explains how technologies like Docker and Kubernetes are used. Docker creates the "container" for the agent, and Kubernetes is a system for managing and scaling many of these containers at once. The other tabs cover "Monitoring & Observability," which is about keeping an eye on the agent's health and performance; "Scaling Strategies," which explains how to handle more users and traffic; and "DevOps for Agents," which is about automating the process of testing and deploying new versions of the agent.

The deployment of AI agents into production environments is a specialized MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) discipline that focuses on reliability, scalability, and maintainability. Containerization using Docker is the standard first step, creating a portable and consistent runtime environment. These containers are then managed by an orchestration platform, typically Kubernetes, which handles automated scaling, service discovery, and self-healing. A robust CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline is crucial. This pipeline automates testing, model validation, and canary or blue-green deployments to minimize production risk. Observability is implemented through the "three pillars": 1) Metrics, using tools like Prometheus to scrape performance data from agent endpoints; 2) Logging, aggregating structured logs into a centralized system like the ELK Stack; and 3) Tracing, using frameworks like OpenTelemetry to trace requests as they flow through complex, multi-agent or multi-service architectures, which is essential for debugging and performance analysis.
