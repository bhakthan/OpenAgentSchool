At an advanced level, MCP Apps fundamentals reveal a carefully designed capability-based security architecture.

The ui:// resource pattern is more than just a naming convention—it establishes a trust boundary. Resources with this scheme are explicitly opt-in for rich rendering. The MIME type profile=mcp-app triggers host-side security policies including iframe sandboxing and CSP enforcement.

Tool annotations via _meta.ui.resourceUri create a declarative binding model. This is intentionally one-way: tools declare their UIs, but UIs cannot arbitrarily invoke tools. All tool invocations must go through the host, which can enforce user consent, rate limiting, and audit logging.

The Host-App protocol in SEP-1865 defines a minimal but complete surface area. The ui/initialize message provides only what apps need: themeMode, locale, and context. There's no way for apps to query arbitrary host state. Similarly, ui/message from apps is just a request—the host decides whether and how to act on it.

Understanding these fundamentals is essential before building production MCP Apps. The constraints aren't limitations—they're the security properties that make it safe to render third-party UIs in sensitive AI contexts.
