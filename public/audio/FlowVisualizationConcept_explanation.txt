This page is about "Flow Visualization," which is a fancy way of saying we draw diagrams to see how AI agents work. Think of it like a flowchart. These visualizations help us understand how an agent makes decisions and how different agents in a team communicate with each other. By seeing the flow, developers can more easily spot problems, find ways to make the agent more efficient, and understand how the whole system works together.

This page explores the concept of visualizing agent workflows. The "Visualization Basics" tab explains the benefits of this approach, such as for debugging and optimization, and introduces different types of diagrams like sequence diagrams and network graphs. The "Visualization Architecture" tab discusses the technology behind these visuals, including popular libraries like React Flow. The "Advanced Visualization" tab features a particularly interesting "Pattern Comparison Timeline," which is an interactive demo that lets you run two different agent patterns—like "Parallelization" and "Chain of Thought"—side-by-side to see how their execution flows and timelines differ.

Flow visualization for AI agents involves representing the dynamic, often non-linear, execution paths of agentic workflows. Technically, this is often achieved by instrumenting the agent's orchestration logic to emit trace data at each step. This trace data, which includes events like 'PLAN_START', 'TOOL_CALL', 'TOOL_RESPONSE', and 'FINAL_ANSWER', is captured and stored. A visualization front-end then renders this data. For simple sequences, a Gantt chart or a sequence diagram can be effective. For more complex, branching workflows (like those in a ReAct pattern), a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a more suitable representation. Libraries like React Flow or D3.js are commonly used to render these graphs, with nodes representing states or actions and edges representing the transitions between them. The ability to interactively explore this graph, inspect the data payload at each step, and compare the execution paths of different runs is a powerful tool for debugging and optimizing complex agent behavior.
