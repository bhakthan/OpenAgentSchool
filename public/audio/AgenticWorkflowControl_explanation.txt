Beginner Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This page is about controlling how an AI agent "thinks" and works through a task. You can choose different "Workflow Patterns." A "Sequential" workflow is like a checklist, where the agent does one step at a time. A "Parallel" workflow is for when the agent can do multiple things at once to save time. You can also control the agent's "Eagerness," which is the balance between thinking and acting. You can tell it to be very cautious and plan a lot, or to act quickly and decisively.

This page explores advanced methods for controlling an agent's execution process. The "Workflow Execution Patterns" section lets you compare three main strategies: Sequential, for tasks that require careful, step-by-step processing; Parallel, for tasks that can be broken down into independent sub-tasks; and Adaptive, where the agent chooses the best strategy based on the problem. The "Eagerness and Timing Control" section has an interactive slider that lets you adjust the agent's tendency to plan versus act. The "Reasoning Effort" slider similarly lets you control the depth of the agent's analysis, from a quick, surface-level look to a deep, comprehensive investigation.

Advanced Explanation

Agentic Workflow Control involves the programmatic management of an agent's execution strategy and cognitive processes. "Workflow Execution Patterns" are implemented through different orchestration logics: a "Sequential" pattern uses a simple loop or a linear chain, while a "Parallel" pattern uses asynchronous programming constructs (like `asyncio.gather` in Python) to execute independent tasks concurrently. An "Adaptive" workflow is more complex, using a meta-agent or a router to select the best execution pattern based on an initial analysis of the task. "Eagerness and Timing Control" is managed by adjusting the agent's internal loop, forcing more planning iterations before action or allowing immediate tool use. "Reasoning Effort" is controlled by dynamically adjusting parameters in the LLM call, such as the number of internal reasoning steps in a Chain-of-Thought prompt or the temperature setting to control creativity versus determinism. "Tool Preambles" are a security and reliability mechanism where context-specific constraints and instructions are prepended to the agent's main prompt right before it uses a tool, ensuring safe and predictable tool integration.
