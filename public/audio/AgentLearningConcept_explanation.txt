This page is about how AI agents learn and get smarter over time. Just like people, agents can learn from experience. The main way they do this is through "Reinforcement Learning." Think of it like training a pet. When the agent does something right, it gets a "reward." When it does something wrong, it gets a "penalty." Over time, it learns to do more of the things that get it rewards, which helps it get better at its job.

This page covers the advanced learning techniques that allow AI agents to adapt and improve. The "Reinforcement Learning" tab explains how agents learn through trial and error, using reward systems to guide their behavior. "Online Learning" is about agents that learn continuously from a stream of new data, which is important for adapting to changing environments. "Transfer Learning" is a powerful technique where an agent can use knowledge it gained from one task to help it learn a new, related task much faster. Finally, "Meta-Learning" is about "learning to learn," where agents get better at learning new things over time.

Agent learning encompasses several advanced machine learning paradigms. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is fundamental, where an agent learns an optimal policy by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties. A common algorithm is Deep Q-Learning (DQN), where a neural network is used to approximate the Q-function, which estimates the value of taking an action in a given state. For adapting to new data without complete retraining, Online Learning (or incremental learning) is used, often with stochastic gradient descent-based algorithms. Transfer Learning is a powerful optimization where a model pre-trained on a large, general dataset is fine-tuned on a smaller, task-specific dataset, significantly reducing training time. The most advanced concept is Meta-Learning, or "learning to learn," where models like MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning) are trained on a variety of tasks to develop a learning algorithm that can quickly adapt to a new, unseen task with very few examples.
