# Continuous Improvement Flywheel Canvas

Design a socio-technical loop that turns telemetry, user insight, and human judgment into prioritized improvements for your AI agents.

## 1. Signal Inputs

List the signals that should automatically enter the flywheel.

| Signal Source | Owner | Refresh Cadence | Quality Gate | Notes |
| ------------- | ----- | --------------- | ------------ | ----- |
| Production Telemetry | | | | |
| Synthetic Eval Harness | | | | |
| Human QA / Red Team | | | | |
| Support Tickets | | | | |
| Voice of Customer | | | | |

## 2. Normalization Pipeline

- **Data Lake / Warehouse Tables:**
- **Labeling or Topic Modeling Steps:**
- **Aggregation Windows (e.g., daily, weekly):**
- **Alert Thresholds:**

## 3. Triage Ritual

| Meeting | Cadence | Participants | Inputs | Outputs |
| ------- | ------- | ------------ | ------ | ------- |
| Improvement Council | Weekly | Product, Ops, EvalOps, Support | Signal dashboard, backlog status | Prioritized actions, owners, due dates |

> **Tip:** Keep triage under 45 minutes. Pre-read dashboards let the meeting focus on decisions, not data wrangling.

## 4. Backlog Conversion

- Template for improvement tickets (Include hypothesis, evidence, impact estimate, experiment design)
- SLA for moving items from triage to backlog (e.g., 48 hours)
- Definition of done for improvements (metrics, documentation, communication)

## 5. Feedback & Celebration

| Channel | Audience | Update Frequency | Content | Owner |
| ------- | -------- | ---------------- | ------- | ----- |
| Release Notes | All stakeholders | Bi-weekly | Improvements shipped, metrics | Product Comms |
| Win Stories | Leadership | Monthly | Before/after impact snapshots | Program Lead |
| Contributor Shout-outs | Guild / Community | Weekly | Recognize signal contributors | Enablement |

## 6. Governance Hooks

- Automatic incident tickets for threshold breaches
- Policy updates triggered by recurring issues
- Quarterly flywheel retrospective (what signals worked, what needs tuning)

> **Reminder:** A healthy flywheel is measurable. Track cycle time from signal to shipped improvement and iterate on bottlenecks every quarter.
