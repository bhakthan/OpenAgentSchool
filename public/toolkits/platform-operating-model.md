# Platform Operating Model Canvas

Clarify how your shared agent platform serves product teams, enforces guardrails, and funds sustainable growth.

## 1. Platform Vision & Value Proposition

- Core promise to consuming teams
- Differentiators versus DIY solutions
- Guardrails that come "for free" with the platform

## 2. Service Tier Catalog

| Tier | Description | Ideal Consumers | Included Capabilities | SLA / Support Model |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Self-Serve | | | | |
| Guided | | | | |
| Managed | | | | |

## 3. Paved Roads & Tooling

- Reference implementations / starter kits available
- Policy-as-code modules provided by default
- Sandbox environments and validation suites

## 4. Guardrails & Compliance Automation

| Control | Trigger | Enforcement Mechanism | Telemetry / Alerts | Owner |
| ------- | ------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ----- |
| Tool usage quota | Excess tool calls | Rate limiter + alert | PagerDuty alert | Platform SRE |
| Safety eval gating | Release pipeline | CI job + dashboard | Quality score drop | EvalOps |
| Sensitive data routing | Data tag detection | Proxy with policy check | Data breach alert | Security |

## 5. Funding & Cost Transparency

- Budget allocation method (e.g., base funding + consumption-based recharge)
- Pricing signals for each tier
- Reinvestment commitments (guardrail automation, reliability) per revenue band

## 6. Governance & Stakeholder Forums

| Forum | Cadence | Participants | Purpose | Inputs |
| ----- | ------- | ------------ | ------- | ------ |
| Adopter Council | Monthly | Top consuming teams + platform leadership | Roadmap feedback, blockers | Usage dashboard, roadmap draft |
| Executive Steering | Quarterly | CIO, Finance, Risk, Platform Director | Strategic bets & funding decisions | KPI scorecard, investment cases |
| Incident Review | As needed | Platform SRE, Security, Product reps | Post-incident analysis | Incident log, mitigation plan |

## 7. Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current | Owner | Notes |
| ------ | ------ | ------- | ----- | ----- |
| Time-to-onboard new team | | | | |
| % of traffic on paved roads | | | | |
| Platform NPS | | | | |
| Guardrail breach rate | | | | |

## 8. Next Quarter Initiatives

- Capability improvements to unlock more autonomy
- Reliability or guardrail upgrades
- Enablement programs for new cohorts

> **Pro Tip:** Share the filled canvas with every consuming team so expectations, support channels, and guardrails stay transparent.
