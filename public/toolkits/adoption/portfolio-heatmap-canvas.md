# Portfolio Heatmap Canvas
## Prioritize Agentic AI Opportunities

---

## Purpose
This canvas helps you evaluate and prioritize candidate workflows for agentic AI adoption across three critical dimensions:
1. **Business Value** - Impact on customers, revenue, cost, or competitive advantage
2. **Technical Feasibility** - Data availability, integration complexity, risk profile
3. **Strategic Fit** - Alignment with organizational priorities and transformation ambition

---

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify Candidate Workflows
List 5-15 workflows/use cases that could benefit from agentic AI. Use the Status Quo Discovery questions as prompts.

### Step 2: Score Each Workflow
Rate each workflow on the dimensions below (1 = Low, 5 = High)

### Step 3: Plot on Heatmap
Use scores to position workflows on a 2x2 matrix (Value vs. Feasibility)

### Step 4: Prioritize
Focus first on "Quick Wins" (High Value + High Feasibility), then "Strategic Bets" (High Value + Medium/Low Feasibility requiring investment)
