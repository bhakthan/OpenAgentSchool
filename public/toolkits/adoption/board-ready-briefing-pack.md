---

### Migration & Rollout Plan

**Phase 1: Platform Build (Weeks 0-6)**
- [ ] Deploy orchestrator + eval harness in dev environment
- [ ] Integrate with [1 pilot system]
- [ ] Establish telemetry pipeline
- [ ] Complete security review

**Phase 2: Pilot Deployment (Weeks 6-12)**
- [ ] Deploy [2 Quick Win agents] to staging
- [ ] Run load testing (simulate [X] concurrent users)
- [ ] Conduct red-team security exercise
- [ ] Rollout to production (10% traffic, gradual ramp)

---

### Technical Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Latency:** Agent response >5s unacceptable | Cache frequent queries; optimize RAG retrieval; use streaming responses |
| **LLM API Downtime:** Provider outage breaks agents | Multi-provider failover; local fallback model for critical paths |
| **Data Drift:** Agent performance degrades over time | Automated drift detection; scheduled retraining; human-in-loop for edge cases |
| **Integration Failures:** Legacy system APIs unreliable | Circuit breakers; graceful degradation; fallback to human handoff |

---

### Anticipated CTO/CIO Questions

**Q: Why not build in-house vs. using vendor frameworks?**  
A: Vendor frameworks (LangGraph, AutoGen) offer battle-tested patterns. Custom components only where differentiation matters (e.g., domain-specific evaluation).

**Q: How do we avoid vendor lock-in with LLM providers?**  
A: Multi-provider strategy via unified abstraction layer. MCP/ACP protocols are provider-agnostic.

**Q: What's the blast radius if an agent goes rogue?**  
A: Agents operate with least-privilege API access. Kill switches + rollback in <5 min. Human-in-loop for high-risk actions.

**Q: Can existing infrastructure handle this?**  
A: Incremental compute needs: +[X]% for Year 1. Cloud-native design scales elastically. No datacenter expansion required.

---

### Recommendation

**APPROVE** technical architecture and proceed with Phase 1 platform build.

**Key Deliverables:**

A: Embedded controls ensure GDPR compliance (right to explanation, erasure). Legal reviewed architecture. Risk: LOW.

**Q: How do we prevent agents from being "jailbroken"?**  
A: Multi-layered defenses: prompt injection detection, policy checks, human-in-loop for sensitive actions. Red-team exercises quarterly.

**Q: What if OpenAI goes down?**  
A: Multi-provider failover to Anthropic/Azure. Critical workflows have local fallback model. SLA: <5 min switchover.
