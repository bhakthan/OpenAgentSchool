- AgentOps (Deployment Pipelines, Monitoring, Cost Management)

### 2026 Agent Patterns
- Skill-Augmented Agent - SKILL.md capability extension for domain expertise
- MCP Server Orchestration - Multi-MCP server federation with unified tool layer
- Multi-LLM Routing - OpenRouter-style intelligent model routing by task/cost
- Agentic IDE - VS Code/Cursor workspace agents with full IDE access
- Guardrails Layer - Real-time safety filtering and policy enforcement
- Supervisor Agent - Hierarchical multi-agent coordination
- Semantic Router - Intent-based agent/tool routing
- Verifier Agent - Output validation and fact-checking

### Production Foundations
- Agent Reasoning Patterns - CoT, ToT, GoT, ReAct for structured thinking
- Agent Memory Systems - Short-term, long-term, episodic, semantic architectures
- Agent Observability - Tracing, debugging, monitoring with OpenTelemetry
- Agent Testing & Benchmarks - SWE-Bench, GAIA, evaluation frameworks
- Prompt Injection Defense - Security patterns against injection attacks
- Human-in-the-Loop Patterns - Approval workflows, escalation, oversight
- Agent Cost Optimization - Token budgets, caching, model routing, batch processing

### Advanced Topics
- Multi-Agent Systems & Orchestration
- Data Autonomy Patterns
- Fine-Tuning Methods (SFT, DPO, RFT)
- Quantum-Enhanced AI & Robotics
- Agentic Commerce & Enterprise Applications

### Applied & Career
