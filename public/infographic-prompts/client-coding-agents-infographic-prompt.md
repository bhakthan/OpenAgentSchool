## Prompt

```
Create an 8K educational infographic titled "Client Coding Agents" using Flat UI Style 2.0.

HEADER SECTION (Blue #3B82F6):
- Large title: "Client Coding Agents"
- Subtitle: "AI-Powered Development Assistants That Code With You"
- Icon: Terminal/code window with AI sparkle

SECTION 1 - THE BIG PLAYERS (Purple #8B5CF6):
Title: "Leading Coding Agents"
Grid of agent cards with logos:
1. "GitHub Copilot" - Octopus icon, "Your AI pair programmer"
2. "Cursor" - Cursor icon, "The AI-first code editor"
3. "Windsurf" - Wave icon, "Agentic IDE by Codeium"
4. "Amazon Q Developer" - AWS icon, "Enterprise coding assistant"
5. "Claude Code" - Anthropic icon, "Claude in your terminal"
6. "Codex CLI" - OpenAI icon, "Command-line coding agent"

SECTION 2 - CAPABILITY COMPARISON (Orange #F97316):
Title: "Feature Matrix"
Comparison table:
| Feature | Copilot | Cursor | Windsurf | Claude |
|---------|---------|--------|----------|--------|
| Autocomplete | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★ |
| Chat | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ |
| Multi-file Edit | ★★☆ | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ |
| Codebase Search | ★★☆ | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ |
| Terminal Agent | ★★☆ | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ |
| MCP Support | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★☆☆ | ★★★ |

SECTION 3 - HOW THEY WORK (Green #22C55E):
Title: "The Coding Agent Loop"
Circular flow diagram:
1. "Understand Context" → Read codebase, files, errors
2. "Plan Changes" → Break down into steps
3. "Generate Code" → LLM produces diffs
4. "Apply Edits" → Modify files automatically
5. "Validate" → Run tests, check errors
6. "Iterate" → Fix issues, continue
Center: "Human reviews and approves"

SECTION 4 - IDE INTEGRATION (Teal #14B8A6):
Title: "Where They Live"
IDE integration diagram:
- "VS Code" - Most agents available
- "JetBrains" - Copilot, Cursor, some others
- "Neovim" - Copilot, Claude
- "Terminal" - Claude Code, Codex CLI
- "Browser" - ChatGPT, Claude.ai
Icons showing editor → agent connection

SECTION 5 - KEY CAPABILITIES (Blue #3B82F6):
Title: "What Coding Agents Can Do"
Capability cards:
🔧 "Code Generation" - Write new functions, classes, files
🐛 "Bug Fixing" - Diagnose and fix errors automatically
📝 "Refactoring" - Improve code structure and quality
📚 "Documentation" - Generate docs, comments, READMEs
🧪 "Test Writing" - Create unit and integration tests
🔍 "Code Review" - Analyze and suggest improvements
🔄 "Migration" - Update dependencies, language versions
💬 "Explanation" - Explain complex code in plain English

SECTION 6 - CONTEXT SOURCES (Purple #8B5CF6):
Title: "How Agents Understand Your Code"
Context pyramid:
- Top: "Current File" - What you're editing
- Second: "Open Files" - Related tabs
- Third: "Workspace" - Full project context
- Fourth: "Symbols" - Functions, classes, types
- Fifth: "Docs" - External documentation
- Base: "MCP Servers" - Custom context sources

SECTION 7 - MCP INTEGRATION (Indigo #6366F1):
Title: "Model Context Protocol"
MCP architecture diagram:
[Coding Agent] ↔ [MCP Client] ↔ [MCP Server] ↔ [Tools/Data]
Example MCP servers:
- "Database" - Query schemas, run queries
- "GitHub" - PRs, issues, repo info
- "Docs" - Project documentation
- "APIs" - External service integration

SECTION 8 - BEST PRACTICES (Green #22C55E):
Title: "Getting the Most from Coding Agents"
Tips grid:
✓ "Write clear instructions" - Be specific about what you want
✓ "Provide context" - Include relevant files and docs
✓ "Review all changes" - Never blindly accept
✓ "Iterate in small steps" - Break down large tasks
✓ "Use @ mentions" - Reference files and symbols
✓ "Configure rules" - Set project-specific guidelines
✓ "Leverage MCP" - Add custom context sources

SECTION 9 - PRODUCTIVITY GAINS (Orange #F97316):
Title: "The Impact"
Statistics visualization:
- "55%" - Faster task completion (bar chart)
- "40%" - More code throughput
- "25%" - Fewer bugs in code
- "3x" - Faster onboarding to new codebases
Source note: "Based on GitHub research studies"

FOOTER (Dark background):
- Key insight: "Coding agents amplify developers—they don't replace them"
- Trend callout: "2025: Agentic coding is the new standard"
- Open Agent School logo

DESIGN NOTES:
- Use code/terminal aesthetic elements
- Show IDE screenshots or mockups
- Include popular agent logos/icons
- Use syntax highlighting colors for code elements
- Show human + AI collaboration visually
- Create professional developer-focused design
```
