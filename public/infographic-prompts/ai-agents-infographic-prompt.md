## Prompt

```
Create an 8K educational infographic titled "What is an AI Agent?" using Flat UI Style 2.0.

HEADER SECTION (Blue #3B82F6):
- Large title: "What is an AI Agent?"
- Subtitle: "Autonomous AI Systems That Think, Decide, and Act"
- Icon: Robot brain with glowing neural connections

SECTION 1 - DEFINITION (Purple #8B5CF6):
Title: "The 5 Core Components"
Circular diagram showing:
1. "Perception" - Eye icon, processes inputs from environment
2. "Reasoning" - Brain icon, analyzes and plans
3. "Memory" - Database icon, stores context and history
4. "Tools" - Wrench icon, executes actions
5. "Learning" - Growth arrow, improves over time
Center: AI agent avatar connecting all components

SECTION 2 - AGENT VS CHATBOT (Orange #F97316):
Title: "Agent vs Traditional Chatbot"
Side-by-side comparison table:
| Chatbot | AI Agent |
|---------|----------|
| Responds to prompts | Takes initiative |
| Single-turn | Multi-turn memory |
| No tool access | Uses external tools |
| Stateless | Maintains state |
| Human-directed | Goal-directed |
| Scripted flows | Autonomous planning |

SECTION 3 - THE AGENTIC LOOP (Green #22C55E):
Title: "How Agents Work: The Agentic Loop"
Circular flow diagram:
1. "Observe" → 2. "Think" → 3. "Plan" → 4. "Act" → 5. "Evaluate" → back to 1
Each step with icon and brief description:
- Observe: "Gather context from environment"
- Think: "Reason about the situation"
- Plan: "Break down into steps"
- Act: "Execute tools and actions"
- Evaluate: "Assess results and adjust"

SECTION 4 - TYPES OF AGENTS (Teal #14B8A6):
Title: "Agent Archetypes"
Four quadrant grid:
1. "Reactive Agent" - Lightning bolt, responds to inputs immediately
2. "Planning Agent" - Chess piece, thinks multiple steps ahead
3. "Learning Agent" - Graduation cap, improves from experience
4. "Multi-Agent" - Network of connected agents, collaborates with others

SECTION 5 - REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES (Indigo #6366F1):
Title: "Agents in Action"
Icon-based examples:
- "Customer Service Agent" - Headset icon, resolves support tickets autonomously
- "Coding Agent" - Terminal icon, writes and debugs code (Copilot, Cursor)
- "Research Agent" - Magnifying glass, gathers and synthesizes information
- "Workflow Agent" - Flow chart, automates business processes
- "Data Agent" - Chart icon, analyzes data and generates insights

SECTION 6 - KEY CAPABILITIES (Blue #3B82F6):
Title: "What Makes Agents Powerful"
Horizontal bar chart showing capability levels:
- "Autonomy" - High (can work independently)
- "Tool Use" - High (API calls, file operations, web search)
- "Memory" - Medium-High (conversation + long-term)
- "Reasoning" - Medium-High (CoT, ReAct patterns)
- "Collaboration" - Medium (can work with other agents)

SECTION 7 - AGENT FRAMEWORKS (Purple #8B5CF6):
Title: "Popular Agent Frameworks"
Logo-style icons with names:
- "LangGraph" - Graph structure icon
- "AutoGen" - Microsoft logo + agents
- "CrewAI" - Team/crew icon
- "OpenAI Assistants" - OpenAI logo
- "Azure AI Agent Service" - Azure icon

SECTION 8 - THE EVOLUTION (Orange #F97316):
Title: "The AI Evolution"
Timeline arrow showing progression:
1. "Rule-Based Systems" → 2. "ML Models" → 3. "LLMs" → 4. "AI Agents" → 5. "Multi-Agent Systems"
Star highlight on "AI Agents" as current breakthrough

FOOTER (Dark background):
- Key takeaway: "AI Agents = LLMs + Memory + Tools + Autonomy"
- Open Agent School logo
- "The future is agentic"

DESIGN NOTES:
- Use consistent iconography throughout
- Employ visual metaphors (robot + brain = AI agent)
- Color code each section distinctly
- Include connecting lines showing relationships
- Make comparison tables easy to scan
- Use gradient backgrounds for depth
- Add subtle glow effects on key elements
```
