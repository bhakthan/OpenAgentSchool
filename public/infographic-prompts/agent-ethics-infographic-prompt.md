## Prompt

```
Create an 8K educational infographic titled "AI Agent Ethics" using Flat UI Style 2.0.

HEADER SECTION (Purple #8B5CF6):
- Large title: "AI Agent Ethics"
- Subtitle: "Building Responsible & Trustworthy AI Agents"
- Icon: Balanced scale with AI brain and heart

SECTION 1 - CORE PRINCIPLES (Blue #3B82F6):
Title: "The 6 Pillars of Ethical AI"
Hexagonal pillar diagram:
1. "Fairness" - Balance scale, equal treatment for all
2. "Transparency" - Eye icon, explainable decisions
3. "Accountability" - Person with checkmark, clear ownership
4. "Privacy" - Lock icon, data protection
5. "Safety" - Shield, prevent harm
6. "Human Control" - Hand icon, human oversight

SECTION 2 - BIAS & FAIRNESS (Orange #F97316):
Title: "Detecting & Mitigating Bias"
Flow showing bias sources:
Training Data → Model Weights → Agent Behavior → Outcomes
With intervention points:
- "Data Audit" - Check training data diversity
- "Bias Testing" - Evaluate across demographics
- "Fairness Metrics" - Measure disparate impact
- "Continuous Monitoring" - Track in production

SECTION 3 - TRANSPARENCY (Teal #14B8A6):
Title: "Making Agents Explainable"
Layered explanation model:
| Level | Audience | What to Explain |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| User | End users | Why this response? |
| Operator | Developers | How agent decided? |
| Auditor | Regulators | Full decision trace |
| Society | Public | System capabilities & limits |

SECTION 4 - ACCOUNTABILITY (Green #22C55E):
Title: "Who Is Responsible?"
Responsibility chain diagram:
[Developer] → [Operator] → [Agent] → [Outcome]
                    ↓
            [Accountability]
Key questions:
- "Who built it?" - Developer liability
- "Who deployed it?" - Operator responsibility  
- "What did it do?" - Agent behavior audit
- "What was the impact?" - Outcome assessment

SECTION 5 - PRIVACY BY DESIGN (Blue #3B82F6):
Title: "Privacy-Preserving Agents"
Privacy protection layers:
1. "Data Minimization" - Collect only what's needed
2. "Anonymization" - Remove identifying information
3. "Consent Management" - User controls their data
4. "Secure Storage" - Encrypted memory systems
5. "Right to Forget" - Delete on request
Icon: Data flowing through privacy shield

SECTION 6 - HUMAN OVERSIGHT (Purple #8B5CF6):
Title: "Human-in-the-Loop Patterns"
Control spectrum diagram:
[Full Automation] ←———————————→ [Full Human Control]
     ↓                              ↓
"Autonomous Agent"           "Human Approval"
     ↓          ↓                  ↓
"Monitor Only" "Escalate High-Risk" "Always Confirm"
Best practice arrow pointing to middle: "Risk-based escalation"

SECTION 7 - HARMFUL BEHAVIORS (Red #EF4444):
Title: "What Agents Must NOT Do"
Warning icons with behaviors:
⛔ "Deception" - Never lie or mislead users
⛔ "Manipulation" - Never exploit vulnerabilities
⛔ "Discrimination" - Never treat groups unfairly
⛔ "Privacy Violation" - Never expose personal data
⛔ "Unauthorized Actions" - Never exceed permissions
⛔ "Harmful Content" - Never generate dangerous outputs

SECTION 8 - ETHICAL FRAMEWORK (Indigo #6366F1):
Title: "Implementing Ethics in Practice"
Checklist workflow:
1. "Design Phase" - Ethics review before building
2. "Development" - Bias testing, safety checks
3. "Deployment" - Human oversight configured
4. "Operation" - Continuous monitoring
5. "Incident" - Clear response procedures
6. "Improvement" - Learn and update

SECTION 9 - REGULATION LANDSCAPE (Teal #14B8A6):
Title: "Global AI Governance"
World map with regulation highlights:
- "EU AI Act" - Risk-based classification
- "NIST AI RMF" - US framework
- "ISO 42001" - AI management standard
- "Industry Standards" - Sector-specific rules
Note: "Compliance ≠ Ethics, but both are required"

FOOTER (Dark background):
- Key principle: "With great autonomy comes great responsibility"
- Callout: "Ethics is not optional—it's foundational"
- Open Agent School logo

DESIGN NOTES:
- Use balanced, harmonious color scheme
- Include human and AI imagery together
- Show balance and fairness visually (scales, equilibrium)
- Use warning colors only for negative examples
- Add trust/verification iconography
- Create sense of responsibility and care
```
