# Agentic AI Design Taxonomy Image

This directory contains the Agentic AI Design Taxonomy visualization used in the concepts section.

The image shows a comprehensive taxonomy of Agentic AI design patterns including:
- Agent design patterns (role-based, behavior, planning, learning)
- Interaction protocols (protocols, task sharing, message passing)
- Framework architectures (graph-based, workflow oriented, modular)
- AI model integration (language models, embedding models, memory models, guardrails)
- Memory systems (short-term, long-term, episodic, semantic)
- Application domains (customer support, content generation, process automation)
- Service-oriented features and open issues
