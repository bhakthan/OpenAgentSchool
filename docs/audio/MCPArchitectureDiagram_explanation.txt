MCPArchitectureDiagram Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beginner Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This page shows you a diagram of the Model Context Protocol, or MCP, architecture. Think of it like a blueprint. On the left, you have the "Clients," which are the AI applications that need to get work done. In the middle, you have the "MCP Servers," which act as a secure bridge. On the right, you have your "Data Sources," like files, databases, or other apps. When you press "Play," you can watch how a request flows from the client, through the secure server, to the data source, and back again.

Intermediate Explanation

This is an interactive visualization of the MCP architecture. The diagram is divided into three main parts: the "Frontend Clients," which are the AI agents or applications making requests; the central "MCP Servers," which manage the protocol; and the "Data Sources," which are the tools and resources the agents need to access. When you play the animation, you can follow the five main steps of a data flow. You can also click the question mark icons on each section to open a "micro-learning" pop-up. This pop-up provides more detailed explanations and code examples, with different levels of complexity for beginner, intermediate, and advanced users.

Advanced Explanation

This `MCPArchitectureDiagram` is a sophisticated React component that uses an SVG to create an animated and interactive architectural diagram. The animation is controlled by `useState` and `useEffect` hooks that cycle through the `dataFlowSteps` array, highlighting the active components and data paths at each stage. The component's most powerful feature is the `microLearningContent` object, which contains a three-tiered set of explanations, code examples, key points, and use cases for each major part of the architecture. The content displayed in the modal is dynamically chosen based on the `activeMicroLesson` and `userKnowledgeLevel` state variables, making this a highly adaptive and deeply technical educational tool.
