A2AMultiAgentSystem Explanation

Beginner Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an interactive demo showing a team of AI agents solving a real-world problem for an e-commerce store. When you press "Play," you'll see a customer ask a question that requires two different kinds of information. A "Customer Service Agent" acts as the team leader. It gives the research part of the job to a "Product Research Agent" and the order lookup part to an "OMS Tool Agent." They all work together, and the Customer Service Agent combines their answers to give the customer a complete response.

Intermediate Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This animation demonstrates how three key technologies—A2A, GenAI-processors, and MCP—work together. The "Customer Service Agent" uses the A2A protocol to delegate tasks to the other two agents. Its internal "thinking" is powered by a "GenAI-processors" pipeline, which helps it break down the problem. To get the order status, it uses the Model Context Protocol, or MCP, to securely connect to the "OMS Tool Agent," which has access to the private order database. After the animation, you can also click the "Show RAG Evolution" button to see a comparison of how this modern, multi-agent approach is a major upgrade over older, traditional systems.

This `A2AMultiAgentSystem` component uses Framer Motion for its declarative animations. The entire sequence is driven by the `animationSteps` array of objects, where each object defines the content for a step, its duration, and which SVG elements to highlight. The `useEffect` hook manages the progression through these steps when `isPlaying` is true. The SVG diagram itself is detailed, with specific CSS classes and IDs for components, paths, and text, allowing for precise highlighting at each step. The component also features a complex "RAG Evolution" diagram that visually explains the architectural shift from monolithic RAG to a distributed, agentic system using Context Engineering, highlighting the roles of A2A and MCP in sourcing context from multiple specialized agents and tools. This is a powerful visualization of a sophisticated, enterprise-grade AI architecture.
